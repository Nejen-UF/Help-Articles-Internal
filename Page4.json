            "body": "<hr>\n<p>Learn how to center containers like divs when the width is variable.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Conventional wisdom has it that if you want to center a container such as a div, your best bet is to define a width and set margin left and right to \"auto\". For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"html\">&lt;div id=\"container\" style=\"width:200px;margin:0 auto\"&gt;<br> your centered, 200 pixel wide container<br>&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>This is fine when you have a defined width, but <strong>what happens when the width varies</strong>?</p>\n<p>There's a great example close to home - within a Hub, a set of floated Item tiles are contained in a div and are required to be centered on the page such that, for example, on a wide screen that can fit it, 6 tiles display on a single row.</p>\n<p>Since we want a maximum of 6 tiles to display on a row, and each tile has a width of 250px, and each tile should be 20px away from its neighbor, the container width is being set to (250 + 20) * 6 = 1620px.</p>\n<p>You'll find this in our CSS which defines the wrapper (.page-aligner) that houses the tiles container:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css\">@media only screen and (max-width: 9999px){<br> .page-aligner {<br> width: 1620px;<br> }<br>}</code></pre>\n<p>While this works, it's rather limiting. If for example a Hub has only 4 Items, those 4 tiles will be off center, because the container will still be 1620px, with the last 2 spots for tiles unfilled.</p>\n<p>There's a <em>better </em>way. And when I say better, I mean <em>different</em>.</p>\n<p>Rather, than forcing a width to the container, we could do something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"html\">&lt;div id=\"wrapper\" style=\"text-align:center\"&gt;<br> &lt;div id=\"container\" style=\"display:inline-block;text-align:left\"&gt;<br> your variable width, centered container<br> &lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>By setting your container to display<em> inline-block </em>(which is safe to use <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=inline-block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-internal=\"false\">cross-browser</a>), it can be aligned according to the text-align property. You'll notice I set the #container's text alignment to \"<em>left</em>\" to return it to the default.</p>\n<p>In this example, rather than setting a width on the wrapper, we could set a <em>max-width</em> instead. That will force the 7th tile to wrap in this case.</p>\n<p>It will also mean not having to define any break-points for smaller screens as now the screen width will determine smaller widths for that wrapper.</p>"

            "body": "<p>When you launch a Hub, you want it to be part of your website. To do that, you'll set up a custom domain for the Hub to live on. Here's how custom domains work, and how you can use them with your Hubs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HA382XSFSXEKXWQ252X3ABRH\">What is a custom domain?</h2>\n<p>When you set up a brand new Hub, the default, co-branded domain usually looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><em>https://mycompany.uberflip.com/</em></pre>\n<p>This is fine for testing, but it's <em>your</em> Hub: you want your customers and prospects to consume your Hub content on your own website — not Uberflip's.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, you can replace the default domain with a <strong>custom domain</strong>. A custom domain allows you to cleanly integrate your Hub with your website by hosting it under a URL that is part of your website, for example <em>resources.mycompany.com.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HA382XSFZBQW8VD07ZRF00P4\">Why use a custom domain?</h2>\n<p>There are two main reasons to host your Hub on a custom domain:</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HA382XSFTHRR4JZQ7FRG93R3\">SEO</h3>\n<p>Using a custom domain is good for your SEO. Having your Hub content be part of your website means that search engines will consider it <em>your</em> content instead of Uberflip's content. This can mean higher and more relevant search results for your content.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HA382XSFPG3XXK9QH5354MHA\">Aesthetics &amp; Branding</h3>\n<p>When you use a custom domain, anyone who visits your Hub will always see the domain you chose, no matter where in the Hub they go. They should never notice that the Hub is actually hosted on Uberflip's servers — from their perspective, it's all part of your website. All link references, email marketing and system notifications will reflect your domain. This allows your visitors to be entirely immersed in the content experience that you create.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HA382XSFJX1D11Q0TVNKC1ZZ\">How does a custom domain work?</h2>\n<p>Your website is hosted on your servers, but Uberflip Hubs are hosted on Uberflip's servers. So how do we bring them together?</p>\n<p>The answer is that we use a little web trickery: we make it seem to your Hub visitors like they're on your website, while the content they're seeing is actually coming from Uberflip's servers. This difference is totally unseen by your visitors — as far as they're concerned, they're still on your website.</p>\n<p>There are two main ways to do this. Depending on what <em>type</em> of custom domain you want, you can use a <strong>subdomain </strong>or a <strong>subdirectory</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HA382XSFJPWMR0M2SBP38CB7\">Subdomains vs. subdirectories</h2>\n<p>If you want to use a custom domain, you first have to choose what you want the URL for your Hub to look like. Specifically, you need to decide which <em>part </em>of the URL will point to your Hub. There are two options: <strong>subdomain</strong> or <strong>subdirectory</strong>.</p>\n<p>To understand what this means, let's look at a simple URL:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360057237231\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<p>As you can see, a basic URL consists of the <strong>protocol</strong>, the <strong>domain name</strong>, and in some cases also a <strong>path</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within the domain name, each element separated by a period is a <strong>subdomain</strong> of the domain to its right. In the example URL above, <em>resources</em> is a subdomain of <em>mycompany.com</em> (and, in fact, <em>mycompany</em> is a subdomain of <em>com</em>).</li>\n<li>The path is anything after the domain name, separated by a slash. It typically refers to a file or folder on the web server associated with the domain name. If it's a folder, it's also called a <strong>subdirectory</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's how this applies to your Hub and its URL. Say your website's domain is <em>mycompany</em>.<em>com</em>, and you want to incorporate your Hub's URL into that domain under the label <em>resources</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you choose a URL based on a <strong>subdomain</strong>, it could look like this:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360057237711\" alt=\"Untitled_document_-_Google_Docs.png\" width=\"553\" height=\"77\">\n</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you choose a URL based on a <strong>subdirectory</strong>, it might look like this:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360057239011\" alt=\"Untitled_document_-_Google_Docs.png\" width=\"644\" height=\"78\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So why does this distinction matter? Because <strong>the process for setting up a Hub on a subdomain is completely different than the process for a subdirectory</strong>, so your choice will determine how you proceed.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HA382XSGPWR57B1C63X107W7\" class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>It's worth mentioning that there's actually a third option: you can also choose to give your Hub its own, <strong>standalone domain</strong>. For example, your Hub could live on a URL like this:</p>\n<pre>https://www.mycompanyhub.com/</pre>\n<p>This option isn't very popular, as most Uberflip customers have an existing website that they want to integrate their Hub with. However, it <em>is</em> possible. In terms of setup this option is identical to the <em>subdomain</em> option, so if you want to go this route, proceed as if you're setting up your custom domain as a <strong>subdomain</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HA382XSG2R8RVBQMSQGMH0Q5\">Which option should I choose?</h2>\n<p>In some ways, using a <strong>subdomain</strong> is the \"default\" option. It's much simpler from a technical standpoint, and is easy and fast to set up. We recommend this for most customers, as it should work no matter what your website hosting situation looks like.</p>\n<p>Using a <strong>subdirectory</strong> is the advanced option. It's much more technically complex to set up, and has certain prerequisites in terms of your website hosting configuration. However, using a subdirectory can offer SEO benefits compared to using a subdomain, because a Hub on a subdirectory of your primary domain will benefit from the existing SEO authority of that domain. In addition, some customers simply prefer the URL of a Hub on a subdirectory for aesthetic reasons.</p>\n<p>If you're not sure which one to choose, understanding a little more about the requirements and setup process for each option might help you to make your decision. See the links below for detailed information on each one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HA382XSG2YPGZ55HN47933XM\">How do I set up a custom domain?</h2>\n<p>Ready to get started with setting up a custom domain?

There are many things to consider before using custom code, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The limited troubleshooting we can do at Uberflip if issues arise</li>\n<li>How you'll implement<strong> version control</strong> (this is not native to the Custom Code feature)</li>\n<li>How changes to the Uberflip base code may impact your Custom Code in the future</li>\n<li>Local regulations (such as GDPR)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please read <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/13648673352333\" target=\"_self\">Using custom code: considerations and warnings</a> before implementing custom code.</strong> That article outlines warnings and things to consider before perusing a custom code solution.</p>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>To use Custom Code, you need to be an <strong>Account Admin </strong>or <strong>Content Manager</strong>.</li>\n<li>If you do not feel comfortable using Custom Code yourself, but want to take advantage of the customization options it offers, our OnBrand Team can help. For more information, please contact your Customer Success Manager or <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\">Uberflip Support</a>.</li>\n<li>This article does not include a description of how the Uberflip Hub front end works, such as element IDs, classes, etc. For this type of information, please refer to our <a href=\"https://developers.uberflip.com/docs/getting-started\">developer guide to customizing the Uberflip Hub front end</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What does Custom Code do?</h2>\n<p>Uberflip comes with <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020130171\">a variety of built-in options for customizing the look and feel of your Hub</a>. But what if you have a vision for your Hub that you can't achieve with these tools? If you're comfortable with writing code, you can use the Custom Code feature to go beyond the standard customization options and change your Hub's appearance and functionality in all kinds of ways.</p>\n<p>With Custom Code, you can create your own snippets of code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any combination of these languages. You can then add these snippets to your Hub, and run them on top of the code that runs the Hub.</p>\n<p>Here are just a few of the things you can do with Custom Code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customize your Hub's design elements, including menus, text, images, and more</li>\n<li>Modify the behaviour of different Hub elements, such as Item Tiles and CTAs</li>\n<li>Import and use custom fonts</li>\n<li>Add tracking pixels and other third-party scripts and plugins to your Hub</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Need a little inspiration? Check out our <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002680272\">Hub Hacks</a> to see a variety of prebuilt code snippets.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How do I use Custom Code?</h2>\n<p>To use Custom Code in your Hub, you create Custom Code blocks. These blocks contain your code snippets along with metadata about the block, such as its name and a brief description of the code functionality.</p>\n<p>Organizing into blocks makes it easy to manage your Custom Code. You can see at a glance what you've added to your Hub, and can quickly enable or disable specific code snippets by toggling their respective blocks on and off.</p>\n<p>Within a block, you can create code snippets with any combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and define the placement of the snippet within the larger Hub code.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you use Custom Code to implement tracking pixels or other functionality with privacy implications, you can assign specific blocks to Privacy Groups. These are tied to settings that visitors to your site can use to opt into or opt out of tracking scripts, which is a GDPR compliance requirement. You can find more information about Privacy Groups and how to use them in <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020222131\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 1: Create a Custom Code block</h2>\n<p>If you want to deploy Custom Code on your Hub, the first thing you need to do is create a new Custom Code block to contain the code.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Uberflip account and navigate to the Hub where you want to add the Custom Code block.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Appearance</strong>, then click on <strong>Custom Code</strong>.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018246311/Hubs___Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Custom Code</strong> menu will appear on the right. In the grey bar below the heading, <strong>click on the +Add Code button.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018246471/Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\"></strong>\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Add New Code</strong> window will appear. Here, type in a <strong>Name</strong> and a <strong>Description</strong> for the block into the corresponding fields. These will help you to identify the block and its purpose/functionality later. When you're ready to proceed, click on <strong>Add Code</strong>.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018246531/Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"466\" height=\"319\">\n</li>\n<li>Your Custom Code block will be created, and you'll be taken to the <strong>Edit block</strong> page, where you can enter your code.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Item-Level Custom Code Blocks</h4>\n<p>By default, Custom Code blocks are added at the Hub level, and the code they contain is inserted into every page on your Hub. As this is the way custom code is most commonly used, the instructions in this article assume that you are creating Hub-level Custom Code blocks.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can also create Custom Code blocks <strong>at the</strong> <strong>Item level</strong>. The code contained within these blocks will be inserted into <em>only that Item's page</em>, <strong>not</strong> the rest of the Hub.</p>\n<p>To create a Custom Code block on a specific Item, navigate to the Item (under <em>Content &gt; Items tab</em>) and then click on <strong>Edit Item</strong>. Here, click on the <strong>Custom Code </strong>tab:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018696892/Hubs___Edit_Article_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Edit_Article_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>The process for creating and working with Item-level blocks is otherwise identical to Hub-level blocks, so the instructions in this article are directly applicable.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_6812550582701546883446863\">Step 2: Choose a placement</h2>\n<p>With the block created, you now need to choose where the code will be placed within the HTML of your Hub. In general, the placement of your code will determine where it is loaded as each page of your Hub loads. The available placements, and the order in which they're loaded, are:</p>\n<dl class=\"dl-horizontal\">\n<dt><strong>1. Head</strong></dt>\n<dd>Code is placed immediately before the <em>&lt;/head&gt;</em> tag, i.e. at the very end of the <em>Head</em> section.</dd>\n<dt><strong>2.

This can be HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any combination. Simply type your code directly into the box provided on the <strong>Code</strong> tab of the <strong>Edit Block</strong> page:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018306591/Hubs___Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"604\"></p>\n<p>The placement you chose will determine the tags shown above and below the code box, i.e. if you chose <strong>Head</strong>, then you would see <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;/head&gt;</em> tags above and below the code box, respectively.</p>\n<p>Keep the following in mind when entering your code:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Simply type <strong>HTML</strong> directly into the field</li>\n<li>To include <strong>CSS</strong>, enclose the CSS code within <em>&lt;style&gt;</em> tags</li>\n<li>To include <strong>JavaScript</strong>, enclose the JavaScript code within <em>&lt;script&gt;</em> tags\n<ul>\n<li>You can find a reference to Uberflip JavaScript Hub events that you can hook into in <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021648891\">this article</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 id=\"h_fe252264-f5af-40e3-a626-2a144225d8e3\" class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>Uberflip loads the <strong>jQuery 3.3.1 library</strong> into all Hub code by default. To use jQuery in your Custom Code, simply write jQuery within <em>&lt;script&gt;</em> tags, using the Body Bottom placement.</p>\n<p><strong>Please do NOT link the jQuery library from jQuery's public CDN in your code</strong>. Doing so can cause conflicting versions of jQuery to be loaded, which can break key functionality in your Hub.</p>\n</div>\n<p>You can  expand the code box to fullscreen by clicking on the <strong>Expand</strong> button in the top right:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018430292/Hubs___Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>To save your code at any time, click on the <strong>Save</strong> button in the lower right corner:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018430352/Hubs___Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>Changes to the code you enter aren't saved automatically, so remember to save your work regularly!</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>The code editor we use here is called <strong>Ace Editor</strong>, and it has lots of useful keyboard shortcuts.

To do that, simply toggle the switch under <strong>Enable Custom Code</strong> to the <strong>on (green) </strong>position:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018326231/Hubs___Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>This switch is accessible on the <strong>Edit block</strong> menu, regardless of whether you are on the <strong>Code Info </strong>or <strong>Code</strong> tabs.</p>\n<p>Enabling a Custom Code block will cause all the code it contains to be used as part of your Hub. This change will take effect immediately.</p>\n<p>At this point, you can also optionally choose to assign the block to a <strong>Privacy Group</strong>. For details about what Privacy Groups are, and how to set them up and use them, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020222131\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Manage Custom Code</h2>\n<p>Whenever you create a Custom Code block, it is added to the <strong>Custom Code</strong> table in your Hub (<em>Appearance &gt; Custom Code</em>):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018446892/Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"701\" height=\"268\"></p>\n<p>This table lists every existing Custom Code block in your Hub. For each block, you can see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Order</strong>: The order in which the block is loaded, relative to other blocks with the same placement</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Name</strong>: The name that was given to the block</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Description</strong>: The description that was entered for the block</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Placement</strong>: The block's placement</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Privacy Group</strong>: The Privacy Group that the block is assigned to, if any</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Enabled Status</strong>: Whether or not the block is currently enabled</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From here, you can <strong>enable/disable blocks</strong>, <strong>edit/delete blocks </strong>and<strong> change the block order</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Enable or disable blocks</h3>\n<p>You can quickly <strong>enable or disable any block</strong> directly from custom code table. Simply use the toggle switch to the right of the block you want to enable or disable:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018327631/Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"699\" height=\"166\"></p>\n<p>Your change will take effect immediately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Edit or delete blocks</h3>\n<p>You can <strong>make changes</strong> to an existing block, or <strong>delete</strong> it, at any time. To do that, hover your mouse over the block in the Custom Code table, and the <strong>Edit</strong> and <strong>Delete</strong> buttons will appear:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018328071/Fullscreen_2019-01-07__12_46_PM.png\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-01-07__12_46_PM.png\" width=\"699\" height=\"107\"></p>\n<p>Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> <strong>(pencil)</strong> button to enter the <strong>Edit block</strong> menu, or on the <strong>Delete</strong> <strong>(</strong><strong>trash)</strong> button to permanently delete the block.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Change block order</h3>\n<p>The order in which Custom Code blocks are inserted into the Hub code is determined by their <a href=\"#h_6812550582701546883446863\">placement</a>. As a result, we generally recommend grouping related functionality into the same block, i.e. placing all CSS in a single block, etc. Within a single block, code is executed from top to bottom as normal, so you can determine the order in which functionality loads by structuring the code accordingly.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you may need to break out different functionality into separate blocks, for example if you need to be able to turn on and off specific tracking scripts independently of one another. If you have multiple separate blocks that all use the same placement, the order in which they will be loaded is the order shown in the Custom Code table:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018464412/Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"696\" height=\"189\"></p>\n<p>If needed, you can modify this order by assigning a specific place in the order to any given block. To do so, <strong>click on the block's order number</strong> under the <strong>Order </strong>column, which will make it editable:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018344191/Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>Now, simply <strong>type in the number</strong> in the order where you want the block to appear (or use the arrow buttons), and press <strong>Enter</strong>. The block will be moved to the specified position in the order:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018344251/Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Code_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"701\" height=\"178\"></p>\n<p>All other blocks affected by this change (i.e. any blocks below the new position of the block that was moved) will automatically be pushed down in the order by one position.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that all blocks will still be loaded based on placement <em>first</em>. For example, a block with a <em>Head </em>placement will always be loaded before a block with a <em>Below Footer</em> placement, regardless of their places in the order.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_fe55d914-443d-4d8e-80ff-853d1e88431a\">Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have OnBrand customizations in your Hub, keep in mind that these are also added as Custom Code blocks. While you are still able to add your own Custom Code, be careful not to accidentally disable the OnBrand blocks, or to modify the existing code inside them.</li>\n<li>As a best practice, you should put all JavaScript in one block if possible. If you also have OnBrand customizations, this means placing your own JavaScript code in the same block as the OnBrand JavaScript code. In this case, your code should go <em>above</em> the OnBrand code.</li>\n<li>All JavaScript must be ES5; ES6 is not supported.</li>\n<li>When creating blocks, keep dependencies in mind: in some cases, a section of code might require other code that lives in a separate block to be executed first. The execution order is determined by placement and block order, so be sure to account for any dependencies when choosing your placements and/or order.</li>\n</ul>"

            "body": "<hr>\n<p>As soon as you make your Hub live and available to the public, it will become searchable by Google. Often that's a good thing — but sometimes you want just the opposite! If you didn't <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018840252\">set the <em>No Robots Meta Tag</em></a> before going public and your Hub is already appearing on Google, you can request that it be removed. Here's how.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Verify site ownership</h2>\n<p>Before you can make a request to remove your website from Google, you'll first have to prove that you actually own the site. In this context, \"the site\" refers to the domain on which your Hub is hosted, whether that's a custom domain, or the default co-branded Uberflip domain. To do that, you need to follow Google's process for verifying ownership of your custom domain. This consists of two steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add your Hub's domain as its own property on Google Search Console</li>\n<li>Verify your ownership of the domain with Google using one of their verification methods.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Google describes how to do these things in their Search Console documentation, here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/34592\">Google: Add a website property</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080\">Google: Ownership verification</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have verified your ownership of the custom domain, you can ask Google to remove it from their search results with the <em>Remove URLs Tool.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Request site removal from Google results</h2>\n<p>Google allows you to remove your Hub's domain from their search results using the <em>Remove URLs Tool</em>. They describe how to do that in this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9689846\" target=\"_self\">Google: Removals tool</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that this is temporary, because Google is actually just removing your Hub's domain from its search results until it reindexes your Hub at some point in the future. This means that you'll need to take additional steps to make the removal permanent. Google describes a few different options on how to do that in the article linked above (see <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9689846#make_permanent\" target=\"_self\">here</a>). One thing you should do on the Uberflip side is set the <em>No Robots Meta Tag</em>, which is described in <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018840252\">this article</a>.</p>"

You can do that from the Uberflip Marketplace, here:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://marketplace.uberflip.com/details/flipbot/\">Uberflip Marketplace: Flipbot</a></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"step-2-create-a-flipbot-form-cta\">Step 2: Create a Flipbot Form CTA</h2>\n<p>Next, you need to <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020989871-Set-Up-a-Form-CTA\">create a dedicated Form CTA</a> for Flipbot in Uberflip. Flipbot uses this Form CTA to communicate with your Marketing Automation Platform (MAP) and pull prospect details.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you create the Form CTA, the fields you choose to include will determine the information that Flipbot provides when it messages a Sales Stream owner (e.g. name, email, company, etc.).</li>\n<li>We also recommend adding the field “ID” (supported in most MAPs) to the Form CTA and setting it as hidden, as this allows Flipbot to differentiate prospect messages by including an emoji face.</li>\n<li>You can design the Form CTA any way you like, as you do not need to place/display it anywhere. The only exception to this is if you configure Flipbot to gate Sales Streams: in this case, the CTA will be displayed to unknown (not yet profiled) prospects.</li>\n<li>If you want to enable the gating option but also want to include fields that should not be visible to prospects, make sure to set these fields to “hidden”.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you create your Flipbot Form CTA, make a note of its CTA ID.

Setting up Flipbot at the account level will apply to all Hubs under that account. If you separately configure Flipbot at the Hub level for any Hub, these settings will override any account-level settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s where you can find Flipbot’s settings:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Account Level:</strong> Navigate to <em>Account Settings &gt; Integration &gt; Connected Services &gt; Apps tab</em>, hover your mouse over Flipbot, then click on the <strong>Edit</strong> (pencil) button.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hub Level:</strong> Navigate to <em>Hubs &gt; Integrations &gt; Apps</em> <em>tab</em>, hover your mouse over Flipbot, then click on the <strong>Edit</strong> (pencil) button.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For help with configuring Flipbot’s various settings, proceed to the <a href=\"#configuration\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Configuration</a> section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step-4-add-flipbot-to-slack-optional\">Step 4: Add Flipbot to Slack (Optional)</h2>\n<p>The last thing to do is to add Flipbot to your Slack workspace.

In either place, hover your mouse over <em>Flipbot</em> and click on the <em>Edit</em> (pencil) button to open Flipbot’s settings.</p>\n<p>There are three types of settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Required Settings</strong>: These settings must be configured for Flipbot to work.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Optional Settings</strong>: These settings control non-essential functionality, and only need to be configured if you want to use the corresponding features.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Extra Feature Settings</strong>: These settings control optional add-on features that aren’t part of Flipbot’s core functionality, but which are available when you install Flipbot.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"required-settings\">Required Settings</h2>\n<p>You must configure the following <strong>required</strong> settings:</p>\n<h4 id=\"map-integration-type\"><strong>MAP Integration Type</strong></h4>\n<p>Use this field to specify the Marketing Automation Platform you’re using.

This data can be incredibly useful to your sales reps, because a lead who is consuming your content is engaged, and is more likely to move further into the sales funnel.</p>\n<p>The problem: this data lives in your MAP, but your sales reps don't. To get the most out of it, you need to <strong>get the data into the hands of your sales reps</strong> by delivering it to a platform that they use in their day-to-day — <strong>Salesforce</strong>. Uberflip's Salesforce integration makes this possible.</p>\n<p>Plus, Salesforce is often the source of truth for revenue in an organization: as a marketer, bringing your Uberflip data into Salesforce can help you to <strong>demonstrate the revenue impact of your content experiences</strong>.</p>\n<h3>What does the integration do?</h3>\n<p>With all of Uberflip's MAP integrations, you have the option of using <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040307932\" target=\"_self\"><strong>custom fields</strong></a> to send data to your MAP about visitor activity in your Hub. When this option is enabled, this data is recorded on the lead profiles of \"known visitors\" (visitors to your Hub who have submitted a <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020989871\" target=\"_self\">Form CTA,</a> linking them to a specific lead profile) in your MAP.</p>\n<p>Uberflip's Salesforce integration takes the same visitor activity data and also sends it to the corresponding <em>Lead</em> or <em>Contact</em> profiles in your Salesforce account. This data is recorded in Salesforce as <strong><em>Activities</em></strong>, which has several benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Acitivities</em> are <strong>highly visible</strong> in both <em>Salesforce Classic</em> and <em>Lighting Experience</em>. They appear:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>On <em>Lead</em>, <em>Contact</em>, and <em>Account</em> profiles in Salesforce, and remain in place when a <em>Lead</em> is converted to a <em>Contact</em>\n</li>\n<li>On <em>Opportunities</em>, as <em>Activities</em> are brought in from <em>Contacts on</em> the associated <em>Account</em>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It's<strong> easy to generate reports</strong> on <em>Activities</em>, with many out-of-the-box reports available in Salesforce</li>\n<li>Setup is very simple, and <strong>does not require creating a new custom object</strong> (which is typically outside of the Marketing department's control, and difficult or time-consuming to set up)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>If you sync your MAP and Salesforce lead databases, any visitor to your Hub who has a lead profile in your MAP will also have a corresponding profile in your Salesforce account. As a result, Uberflip's Salesforce integration is also able to feed the same visitor activity data it records in your MAP to the corresponding Salesforce profile.</p>\n<p>To do this, the integration first locates the lead profile in your MAP (using the MAP's tracking script/cookie), then uses information from this profile to look up the corresponding Salesforce <em>Lead</em> or <em>Contact</em> profile. If it is able to find a Salesforce profile, the integration then writes a new <em>Activity</em> to that profile, containing details about the lead's activity in your Hub. You can even set default SFDC <em>Priority</em> and <em>Status</em> values for each type of <em>Activity</em> in order to tie them into your sales workflows.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>The integration will only create <em>Activities</em> in <strong>existing</strong> Salesforce <em>Lead</em> and <em>Contact</em> profiles.

Instead, Uberflip leverages your MAP's tracking functionality to look up the visitor's lead profile in the MAP, then looks for their Salesforce <em>Contact ID</em> or <em>Lead ID</em> in that profile to find the appropriate Salesforce profile.</p>\n<p>In order for this to work, Salesforce <em>Lead IDs</em> and/or <em>Contact IDs</em> must therefore appear on lead profiles in your MAP. While you can add them manually, an easier option is to <strong>automatically sync lead profiles between your MAP and your Salesforce account</strong>. This functionality is supported in all of the MAPs that Uberflip integrates with.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about how to sync lead profiles between your MAP and Salesforce in the following articles:</p>\n<h4>Marketo</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.marketo.com/display/public/DOCS/Salesforce+Sync\"><strong>Marketo: Salesforce Sync</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>HubSpot</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/salesforce/sync-salesforce-accounts-to-hubspot\"><strong>HubSpot: Sync Salesforce accounts to HubSpot</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Oracle Eloqua</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/marketing/eloqua-user/Help/Apps/SalesforceApp/SalesforceApp.htm\"><strong>Oracle Eloqua: Salesforce Integration app</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Pardot</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=pardot_prospect_syncing_between_pardot_and_salesforce.htm&amp;type=5\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Pardot: Syncing Prospects Between Pardot and Salesforce</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 1: Connect your account to Salesforce</h2>\n<p>You can now begin setting up the Salesforce integration by connecting your Salesforce account to Uberflip.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_88422551661547841328605\" class=\"callout__title\">Choosing a Salesforce Account</h4>\n<p>To complete this process, you will need to log in to a Salesforce account, and this account will be used to authorize and manage the connection between Salesforce and Uberflip. We strongly suggest that you <strong>do not use an account associated with a specific individual</strong>. If you do, your Uberflip integration can stop working if that user leaves your company, or their Salesforce account is deactivated.</p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Uberflip account and select any Hub.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Integrations</strong>, then click on <strong>Connected Services:</strong><br><strong><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4407530487053/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></strong>\n</li>\n<li>On the right, you'll see a list of services that Uberflip can integrate with.

Learn how to create a Blog Stream by importing your existing blog content, or by creating a blog from scratch.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Before you begin</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To create Blog Streams, you need to be an <strong>Account Admin</strong> or <strong>Content Manager</strong>.</li>\n<li>If you want to import posts from an external blog into Uberflip, you will need the URL that points to that blog's RSS feed. It typically looks something like <em>http://www.myblog.com/feed/ </em>or similar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About Blog Streams</h2>\n<p>Blog Streams are used to aggregate blog content in your Hub. They're a great way to optimize and showcase your best top-of-funnel content.</p>\n<p>You can create Blog Streams in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Import content from an externally hosted blog (e.g. WordPress or Drupal) with RSS</li>\n<li>Create a new blog from scratch in Uberflip</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you import an external blog into Uberflip, this can either be a blog you own, or a third-party blog. The second option is useful if you want to pull in feeds from influencers or popular industry blogs to round out your Hub’s content.</p>\n<p>If you instead choose to create a new blog from scratch with Uberflip's built-in blogging functionality, you'll need to manually add content to it by using the built-in blog post editor. You can also use this same built-in blogging functionality on Blog Streams that import content from an external blog, either to manually add new posts from within Uberflip, or to modify imported posts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Setup: Prepare your external blog for importing into Uberflip</h2>\n<p>To get the best results when you import your external blog content into Uberflip, you should check on its RSS feed settings <em>before</em> creating the Blog Stream in Uberflip. This is necessary because, by default, your RSS feed is probably not set up to include all your existing articles, or may not be configured in a way that allows Uberflip to pull in images.</p>\n<p>For more information, and for instructions on how to optimize your external blog's RSS feed for Uberflip, see this article:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020841051\" target=\"_self\">Optimize Your Blog's RSS Feed for Uberflip Streams</a></p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info: WordPress Blogs</h4>\n<p>If your external blog is hosted on WordPress, and you use the Featured Images feature on your posts, WordPress does not include these images in its RSS feed.

If your thumbnails are smaller than this, you can enable this option to use them anyway.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Automatically match author profiles</strong><strong>: </strong>If the authors of the content on the external blog also exist as <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019000331\" target=\"_self\">authors in Uberflip</a>, enabling this option will match the appropriate Uberflip author profiles to the imported content.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Allow class attributes, style and font tags to be imported:</strong> By default, Uberflip strips out CSS class attributes and other tags when importing external content. Enable this option to keep these elements intact in the content after import. Note that any referenced classes, fonts, etc. must be defined in <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_self\">your Hub's Custom Code</a> for the corresponding formatting to be retained.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Automatically create and apply tags from RSS to items</strong><strong>: </strong>Enable this option to automatically create Uberflip tags from any tags contained in the RSS feed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_6c35c954-15e0-4c65-a547-ebd6678f09b0\">Create a new blog from scratch in Uberflip</h2>\n<p>As an alternative to importing content from an outside blog, you can also choose to create an empty Blog Stream.

This article will show you how.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J044Z9D1R4Y7DT2PKB4NV9KF\">Before You Begin</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To use Site Engager, you need to be an <strong>Account Admin</strong>.</li>\n<li>You will need access to the website code (HTML) of the web property on which you want to use Site Engager.</li>\n<li>If you want Site Engager to use <a href=\"https://www.uberflip.com/ai/\">the Uberflip recommendation engine</a> to generate content suggestions, you must set up a <strong>Bombora</strong> integration on your Hub. For instructions, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022588451\">Set Up a Bombora Integration</a>.</li>\n<li>The recommendation engine is only available on certain pack types. If your pack type does not include it, you'll still be able to use Site Engager, but won't be able to select the engine as a recommendation option. For more information about your pack type and what's included, please contact your Customer Success Manager, or Uberflip Support.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J044Z9D1BM5R9ZF4R56YVQ95\">About Site Engager</h2>\n<p>Serving up personalized content recommendations to your visitors is an effective way of increasing their engagement. Uberflip's <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022410572\">Content Recommendations</a> feature takes care of serving up recommendations in your Hub, but what about prospects that haven't made it to your Hub yet?</p>\n<p>Site Engager goes hand-in-hand with Content Recommendations, and recommends content from your Hub on any of your other web properties. Like Content Recommendations, Site Engager uses <a href=\"https://www.uberflip.com/ai/\">Uberflip's recommendation engine</a> to customize recommendations to your visitors' needs and interests, maximizing their relevance and value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J044Z9D1GSKDWDFMWVSNY4P2\">Where Are Recommendations Shown?</h3>\n<p>Site Engager displays recommendations in two main ways. The first of these is the <strong>Promo Tile</strong>, which appears along the left or right side of a webpage:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021117811\" alt=\"Optimize_Your_Content_Marketing_Efforts___Uberflip_Content_Experiences.png\" width=\"531\" height=\"380\"></p>\n<p>The other is the <strong>Exit Intent Popup</strong>, which is shown when the visitor moves their mouse near the top of the page (i.e. towards either their browser's <em>Back</em> or <em>Close Tab/Window</em> buttons):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021117671\" alt=\"_DRAFT_COPY__Serve_Hub_Content_Recommendations_on_Your_Website___Uberflip_Help.png\"></p>\n<p>In both cases, interacting with the recommendation will expand it in a <strong>viewer</strong>, which can also recommend further Items for the visitor to look at next, or let them go back to the previous one:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021179932\" alt=\"Create_Better_Account-Based_Marketing_Campaigns___Uberflip.png\" width=\"701\" height=\"489\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J044Z9D1DS9XWCTA3PCNRBPQ\">Does it Work on Mobile?</h3>\n<p>Site Engager will display recommendations in mobile browsers, as well, but the experience is slightly different. On mobile devices, only the the Promo Tile is used, where it appears as a banner at the bottom of the screen:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360023487711\" alt=\"Account-Based_Marketing_Tools_to_Scale_Personalized_Content___Uberflip.png\" width=\"291\" height=\"267\"></p>\n<p>This banner-style Promo Tile will appear on mobile phones and on tablets in portrait mode, while tablets in landscape mode and very large tablets (e.g. the iPad Pro) will still use the desktop-style Promo Tile.</p>\n<p>Interacting with the banner-style Promo tile does not open the viewer. Instead, tapping on the recommendation banner will open the Item in a new browser tab/window. However, in cases where the regular Promo Tile is displayed on mobile (i.e. large tablets, or tablets in landscape), tapping on it will open the desktop-style viewer (note that the viewer will disappear if the user turns their tablet back to portrait mode).</p>\n<p>The Exit Intent Popup will not appear on any mobile device, regardless of size or orientation. This is because it uses mouse movement to detect when a user is likely to exit the current page, which isn't available on mobile devices.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J044Z9D1WAWQYZ2SQEP19SV4\">Install Site Engager on your Website</h2>\n<p>To use Site Engager on your website, you first need to install it. This is as simple as pasting a lightweight JavaScript snippet into the HTML of your website. You can choose to embed the snippet in the main template of your website, or on individual pages. Since Site Engager is configured entirely within the Uberflip App, you won't need to do any coding (or ask your developers for help) to set it up and use it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To get the Site Engager snippet, log in to your Uberflip account and navigate to <strong>Website Tools &gt; Site Engager </strong>using the sidebar menu on the left:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021180052\" alt=\"Hubs___Site_Engager_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>In the Site Engager interface on the right, click on the <strong>Embed Script</strong> tab:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021180132\" alt=\"Hubs___Site_Engager_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"523\" height=\"271\">\n</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Copy to Clipboard </strong>button to copy the code snippet.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021117791\" alt=\"Hubs___Site_Engager_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"612\" height=\"186\">\n</li>\n<li>Now, simply <strong>paste the snippet into your website's HTML</strong>, within the <em>&lt;body&gt;</em> tags.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J044Z9D1MAXMSP9HG6J39Y8X\">Set Up Site Engager Recommendations</h2>\n<p>Once Site Engager is installed on your website, you can configure the recommendations it serves in the Uberflip app. As with <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022410572\">recommendations on your Hub</a>, you configure Site Engager recommendations using two core components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Templates</strong> determine how recommendations are displayed on your website. They allow you to define the look and feel of your recommendations, such as how many Items are recommended, positioning of the Promo Tile, etc.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Rules</strong> define the placement and source of recommendations. In other words, they control where on your website a set of recommendations will be shown, and what content will be recommended. You can enable or disable individual rules, which allows you to control whether a specific recommendation setup is active (enabled) or inactive (disabled).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These components work together to serve recommendations. To configure Site Engager, you set up a rule to define the details of the recommendations (i.e. the \"what\" and the \"where\"), then assign a template to that rule to define look and feel. Finally, you enable the rule to begin serving the corresponding recommendations on your website.</p>\n<p>If you're setting up Site Engager for the first time, we recommend that you begin by <a href=\"#h_12979823381549912979242\">creating a template</a> (to set up the look and feel). You can then <a href=\"#h_7807057911371549314138895\">create your first rule</a> and use the template you set up with it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_4249929981061549314107420\">Manage Templates</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_12979823381549912979242\">Create a Template</h3>\n<p>You can create as many templates as you like for different purposes. Templates can be assigned to different rules, and switched out at any time.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Uberflip, navigate to <strong>Website Tools &gt; Site Engager </strong>using the sidebar menu on the left:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021119811\" alt=\"Hubs___Site_Engager_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>In the Site Engager interface on the right, click on the <strong>Templates</strong> tab:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021120051\" alt=\"Hubs___Site_Engager_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"497\" height=\"226\">\n</li>\n<li>Your existing templates will be shown in the list below the tabs. By default, there will be only one template here, the <a href=\"#h_833461621731549056092423\">Default Template</a>.</li>\n<li>To add a new template, click on the <strong>+New Template</strong> button in the top left:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021182252\" alt=\"Hubs___Recommendation_Templates_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Enter a <strong>name</strong> to identify your new template, as well as a brief <strong>description</strong> (optional) in the fields provided, then click on <strong>Add Template</strong>.

All changes you make here will be saved automatically and applied immediately.</li>\n<li>You can also create new templates from the <strong>Edit Template</strong> view by copying an existing template.

It is automatically selected for all newly created rules.</p>\n<p>The Default Template's purpose is to act as a fallback: if a custom template used by a rule is deleted, the Default Template will be used instead. As a result, the Default Template is the only template that can't be deleted — but you can modify it to suit your needs.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J044Z9D2TKXHGRGE62FMHN2R\">Edit or Delete a Template</h3>\n<p>You can edit or delete templates at any time, even if they are currently assigned to to one or more rules.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can <strong>edit</strong> any existing template, including the Default Template. While viewing the list of templates (<strong>Site Engager &gt; Templates tab</strong>), hover your mouse over the template you want to edit, then click on the <strong>pencil button </strong>on the right:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021121651\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-02-01__2_35_PM.png\" width=\"613\" height=\"36\">\n</li>\n<li>As with creating a new template, this will open the <strong>Edit Template</strong> view.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deleting a template</strong> is similar to editing: hover your mouse over it, then click on the <strong>trash can button </strong>on the right.

Click on <strong>OK</strong> to confirm the deletion.<br>\n<ul>\n<li>If the template is still associated with any rules, this will be noted in the prompt as well.

This is because the engine takes a little while to collect the data it needs to provide meaningful recommendations for visitors.</p>\n<p>Note that the Hub from which recommendations are drawn must have visitors in order for recommendations to be generated. The recommendation engine also uses Bombora intent data, and Bombora likewise requires visitors to generate this data. If you only recently set up your <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022588451\">Bombora integration</a> and it has not yet collected enough visitor data, this means you won't see any recommendations yet.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J044Z9D39CCJ1DZDSRDQNWKM\">Edit or Delete a Rule</h3>\n<p>You can edit or delete rules at any time, even if they are currently enabled. (Deleting an enabled rule will also deactivate it.)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can <strong>edit</strong> any existing rule. While viewing the list of rules (<strong>Website Tools &gt;</strong><strong>Site Engager &gt;</strong><strong> Rules tab</strong>), hover your mouse over the rule you want to edit, then click on the <strong>pencil button </strong>on the right:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021126671\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-02-11__2_03_PM4.png\" width=\"571\" height=\"55\">\n</li>\n<li>As with creating a new rule, this will open the <strong>Edit Rule</strong> view.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deleting a rule</strong> is similar to editing: hover your mouse over it, then click on the <strong>trash can button </strong>on the right.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021187432\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-02-05__12_13_PM5.png\">\n</li>\n<li>You'll see a prompt asking if you're sure you want to delete the rule.

If you have conflicting rules for a given page (i.e. two or more rules that apply to the page), you can adjust the rule order to determine which rule takes precedence and serves recommendations on that page.</p>\n<p>Generally, conflicts occur where rules with narrow scopes (e.g. just one page) and wider scopes (multiple pages) overlap. When ordering conflicting rules, you want the rule with the <em>narrowest</em> scope to have the highest priority. That way, a rule scoped to just one page will only apply to that page, while more widely-scoped rules will apply to all other pages that don't have their own single-page rule.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>While viewing your list of rules (<strong>Website Tools &gt;</strong><strong>Site Engager &gt;</strong><strong> Rules tab</strong>), find the rule you want to reorder.</li>\n<li>Click on the number in the <strong>Order</strong> column for the rule:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021187492\" alt=\"Hubs___Site_Engager_-_Uberflip6.png\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Type in the new position</strong> in the order where you want this rule to appear (or use the arrow buttons), then press <strong>Enter</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021126711\" alt=\"Hubs___Site_Engager_-_Uberflip7.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The rule will be moved to the chosen position in the order, and the other rules in the list will be automatically reordered to accommodate the change (i.e. they will be shifted up or down the order by one position as needed):<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360021187512\" alt=\"Hubs___Site_Engager_-_Uberflip8.png\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01J044Z9D3HH9D67Q35KVH1YWC\" class=\"callout__title\">Best Practice: The \"Catch All\" Rule</h4>\n<p>We recommend creating a \"Catch All\" rule to serve recommendations anywhere that no page-specific rule exists. This rule should offer general recommendations (ideally powered by the recommendation engine), and you should make sure that it is set to the lowest position in the order so that all page-specific rules take priority.</p>\n</div>"

Form CTAs are specifically designed to send the data they collect where you can actually use it: your <strong>Marketing Automation Platform </strong>(MAP).</p>\n<p>For this reason, all Form CTAs must be connected to a map during setup. This deep integration is what makes Form CTAs such a powerful tool, because it eliminates any obstacles between collecting the data and actually leveraging it.</p>\n<p>Since MAPs are integral to the way Form CTAs work, you will need to be using a supported MAP if you want to use Form CTAs. The following MAPs are currently supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022207231\" target=\"_self\">Oracle Eloqua</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022063751\" target=\"_self\">Marketo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021562692\" target=\"_self\">HubSpot</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021942272\" target=\"_self\">Pardot</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037491672\" target=\"_self\">MailChimp</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before creating a Form CTA, you should set up an Integration between your MAP and Uberflip. To learn more about integrating your MAP (or other apps) with Uberflip, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020907752\">this article</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HB6Z7VKRAY3B0BYC5H39GRYH\" class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>Any given Form CTA can only be connected to a single MAP. However, if you have multiple MAPs connected to your Hub, you can specify the MAP to be used individually for each CTA. As a result, you can have different Form CTAs connected to different MAPs if you want.</p>\n<p>(Note that connecting multiple MAPs to your Hub is only available on <strong>Enterprise</strong> pack types.)</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB6Z7VKR5CESMXYV7505PY9Q\">Form CTA Structure</h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, a Form CTA is basically a <em>form</em>: a collection of text fields used to enter data. However, to make Form CTAs more visually appealing, the full form is not initially displayed. To enable this, Form CTAs have multiple <strong>states</strong>, so that the appearance of the Tile changes as a visitor interacts with it. There are four states:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Default</strong>: This is how a Form CTA appears initially, with the Tile displaying simply the tagline and a single text input field (the first field configured in the form).<br><br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360017795951\" alt=\"Lead_Generation_through_Digital_Experience_Management___Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Focus:</strong> When a visitor interacts with the Form CTA by clicking on the first (visible) field, it will switch to the <em>Focus</em> state.

When you enable this option, a text field will appear: here, paste in the URL of the Form Handler you want to use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360028589752\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HB6Z7VKSGVBH7R1KMCN3TYXF\" class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>When you enable this option, you must also enable the <strong>Never hide this CTA</strong> option at the same time. This is because a Form Handler is fired only when a visitor submits a Form CTA, so if a Form CTA is hidden (because a known visitor is already fully profiled), the Form Handler can't be fired. </p>\n<p>Given this restriction, keep in mind that using Form Handlers means that visitors may be asked to submit the same Form CTA multiple times.</p>\n</div>\n<p>When you have finished configuring the structure of your Form CTA, click on <strong>Next</strong> to proceed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FF689CEZ6FJ12W1K7CW0FSCM\">Style a Form CTA</h2>\n<p>In the <strong>Design</strong> section of the Form CTA Editor, you can style your CTA by selecting colors and font size, and (optionally) setting a background image.</p>\n<p>You can get here by clicking the <strong>Next</strong> button from the <strong>Layout</strong> section, or by clicking on the <strong>Design</strong> button directly:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4408893142541\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB6Z7VKSAFN4KA1WHCVVZNJJ\">Colors</h3>\n<p>You can set colors for four separate elements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Font color</strong>: The text color for the tagline (<em>Default</em> state), form field labels (<em>Focus</em> state) and Success Message (<em>Success</em> state)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Background color</strong>: The color used for the background of the CTA Tile across all states</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Button font color:</strong> The color of the button text for the Submit button (<em>Focus</em> state) and the Link to Content button (<em>Success</em> state)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Button background color: </strong>The color of the button body for the Submit button (<em>Focus</em> state) and the Link to Content button (<em>Success</em> state)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use the dropdown for each color option to choose a color from a list of <strong>presets</strong>, using the <strong>color picker</strong>, or by entering a <strong>hex code</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360017928632\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"417\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB6Z7VKSBH0A3RG27Q6APFKB\">Tagline Font Size</h3>\n<p>Use the <strong>Tagline/Copy Font Size</strong> slider to adjust the size of the tagline font. The text will re-flow automatically based on your selection. If your tagline is very long, your text may \"slide off\" the <em>Default</em> state of the Tile (or under the visible form field) with the default font size:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360017928772\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"701\" height=\"418\"></p>\n<p>To fix this, try moving the slider to the left until all the text is visible:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360017814451\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"418\"></p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HB6Z7VKS0PF6FTVR63KNGCZ1\" class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>When the the tagline is re-flowed to adjust for different font sizes, long words will not be broken up across lines (hyphenated), so individual lines can be different lengths. Although the maximum character limit for taglines is 150, the <em>practical</em> limit may be lower if you use longer words, because they cannot be broken up across lines as efficiently. In other words, some very long taglines may still \"slide under\" the button even at the lowest font size setting.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Only the tagline font size can be changed: the button label, form field label and Success Message fonts are a fixed size, and can't be adjusted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB6Z7VKS9CE8M1RK3R46V58G\">Background Image</h3>\n<p>If you want, you can use a background image instead of a solid background color. Background images should be <strong>330 pixels high by 250 pixels wide</strong>, and should be in <strong>JPEG</strong> format.</p>\n<p>To set a background image, click on the <strong>Upload</strong> button and choose an image to use.</p>\n<p>On the next window that appears, use the slider to adjust the crop of your background image (the white outline represents the part that will be visible within the Tile):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360017815151\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>When you're finished, click on <strong>Save</strong> to apply your background image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360017815411\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"699\" height=\"418\"></p>\n<p>The background image you set will override the <strong>Background color</strong> setting for <strong>only</strong> the <em>Default</em> state.

You'd need to actually edit the underlying PDF for that. To understand what it <em>can</em> do, and why it can be a useful tool, we first need to look at what happens with text when you upload a PDF.</p>\n<p>When you upload a PDF to Uberflip, it gets converted into a Flipbook. As part of this conversion process, our system extracts the text from the PDF and stores it in the Flipbook (along with any embedded fonts). This text is not visible to anyone who reads the Flipbook. Instead, this \"invisible text\" has two uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Search: </strong>Search engines usually can't read a standard PDF, but they <em>can </em>read the accompanying extracted text. This great for surfacing your Flipbook content in search results, both in Google and in Hub Search.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Text Only</strong> <strong>Tool</strong>: On mobile devices, Flipbook readers can use a \"text only\" option, which can make Flipbooks easier to read on smaller screens. When this option is used, the extracted text is what is displayed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Flipbook text parser will only be able to extract text from your PDFs if you have <strong>embedded your fonts</strong>, so you should always make sure to do this when creating PDF content that you intend to present as a Flipbook. The parser is <strong>not</strong> able to extract:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Non-embedded text</li>\n<li>Text in image format</li>\n<li>Embedded text that uses a CID-based or Embedded Open Type (EOT) font</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because there's a possibility that your PDF's text hasn't been extracted in full, it's a good idea to check, and to correct any errors that might exist. This is where the Flipbook Editor's Text Tool is useful, because you can use it to review and fix all extracted text in your Flipbook.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HMSB59JRT45G7JK9VX29M51H\">View &amp; Modify Extracted Flipbook Text</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Open up the Flipbook page Editor for the Flipbook you want to work on.</li>\n<li>In the Tools Menu on the right, click on the<strong> Text tab</strong>.<br><br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360016689232\" alt=\"Page_Editor_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>This tab will display the extracted text from the Flipbook page that is currently displayed in the viewer on the left side:</li>\n<li>Check the text for any missing passages or errors.

The purpose of setting up a custom domain is to make your Uberflip Hub look like it's part of your website, even though it's being hosted on Uberflip's servers. With a subdomain, this means making your Hub accessible under a URL like <em>resources.mycompany.com</em>, i.e. a <em>sub</em>domain of your website's main domain.</p>\n<p>To do this, you'll need to set up the subdomain to point at your Hub by creating a CNAME record with your web hosting provider. A CNAME record is essentially an alias: it tells a browser \"if a user asks for <em>URL A</em>, tell them that they're looking at <em>URL A</em>, but actually show them content from <em>URL B</em> instead.\" In this case, <em>URL A</em> is your subdomain, and <em>URL B</em> points to your Hub on Uberflip's servers.</p>\n<p>Here's a breakdown of how this process works:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Your Hub is hosted on Uberflip's servers at <em>read.uberflip.com</em>. This is the domain where we host all Hubs.</li>\n<li>To get to your Hub, you want your users to visit a URL that's part of your website. This will be a subdomain of your website, in the form of <em>[something].mycompany.com.</em>\n</li>\n<li>First, you'll create the subdomain you want to use. Let's say you choose <em>resources.mycompany.com</em>.</li>\n<li>Next, you'll set up a CNAME record that points <em>resources.mycompany.com</em> at <em>read.uberflip.com</em>. This takes anyone who goes to <em>resources.mycompany.com</em> to <em>read.uberflip.com</em> instead, but makes it look like they're still on <em>resources.mycompany.com</em>.</li>\n<li>Finally, you register <em>resources.mycompany.com</em> as a custom domain on your Uberflip account, then associate it with the target Hub. This tells Uberflip's servers which Hub to serve up when a visitor arrives at <em>read.uberflip.com</em> from <em>resources.mycompany.com</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HA38AH01HHS2ZVJ6F5GYQ6T2\">Step 1: Choose a subdomain name</h2>\n<p>The first step is deciding what to name your Hub's new subdomain. This is where your visitors will go to access your Hub, so it's time to get creative! We recommend choosing something that describes what your visitors can expect to find in your Hub. Here are some examples to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>resources</strong>.mycompany.com</li>\n<li>\n<strong>insights</strong>.mycompany.com</li>\n<li>\n<strong>learn</strong>.mycompany.com</li>\n<li>\n<strong>community</strong>.mycompany.com</li>\n<li>\n<strong>hub</strong>.mycompany.com</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_8190d454-2493-4df7-bab4-b93118d88521\">Step 2: Create the subdomain and set up a CNAME record</h2>\n<p>When you have decided on the name for your Hub's subdomain, all that's left is to create it as a subdomain of your existing website. Initially, your newly created subdomain won't actually point at anything: anyone who goes there would see a <em>404 Not Found</em> error. To fix that, you'll also need to point the subdomain at Uberflip's servers by creating a CNAME record with your hosting service provider.</p>\n<p>In most cases, you'll need to have your website admin or IT team create the subdomain and set up the CNAME for you. Ask them to complete the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Create a subdomain</strong> on the root domain. The specific subdomain name to be created is [<em>fill in subdomain you chose, e.g. hub.mywebsite.com</em>].</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Create a CNAME record</strong> with your domain provider that points [<em>fill in subdomain you chose</em>] to the hostname <strong>read.uberflip.com </strong>(e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">hub.mywebsite.com CNAME read.uberflip.com</code>) You can usually find instructions on how to create a CNAME record in your domain provider's help documentation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the subdomain and CNAME record have been set up, you can test if it's working properly:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Go to <a href=\"https://www.whatsmydns.net/\">whatsmydns.net</a>. </strong></li>\n<li>In the URL field at the top, <strong>type in your new subdomain</strong>.</li>\n<li>Use the dropdown menu to <strong>select</strong> <em><strong>CNAME</strong></em>.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4406952242573\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Search</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the list of servers shown on the page, <strong>you should see <em>read.uberflip.com</em></strong> as the result for all servers, like this:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4406959375373\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>If you see any errors, let your website admin/IT team know so they can troubleshoot.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_544727903291542035460322\">Step 3: Link the subdomain to your Hub in Uberflip</h2>\n<p>You've now set up your new subdomain so that anyone who visits it will be taken to Uberflip's servers at <em>read.uberflip.com</em>. At this point, the subdomain isn't associated with a Hub on the Uberflip side yet, so anyone who goes there would see an error saying that the Hub couldn't be found. To fix this, you need to register the new subdomain in your Uberflip account, then link it to your Hub.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Uberflip account, click on <strong>Hubs</strong> in the menu bar at the top, then click on the Hub that you want to link to the new subdomain.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Hub Options</strong> to expand that section, then click on <strong>Change D</strong><strong>omain</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4406957415693\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>This will open the <strong>Move Hub to another Domain</strong> page.

On the <strong>Move Hub to another Domain</strong> page, use the <strong>Select a Domain</strong> dropdown menu to choose the subdomain you just created.</li>\n<li>Finally, click on the <strong>Move Hub</strong> button to complete the process:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4406952380941\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>You should see a message at the top of the window confirming that you've successfully <strong>moved your Hub onto a custom domain</strong>.

Note, however, that if a video appears in multiple groups, or if you create Streams for both specific groups and with the all videos option, you will have duplicate video Items in your Hub as a result.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the option you choose, the Vimeo Stream you create will remain connected to either the account as a whole or the specific group, and will continue to pull in any new content you publish there automatically.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Uberflip, <strong>navigate to the Hub</strong> where you want to create the new Vimeo Stream.\n<ul>\n<li>The new Vimeo Stream will be created under the Hub you choose, and will only be visible on the <em>Streams</em> tab of that Hub. However, the Items pulled into the Stream from Vimeo can be added to Marketing and Sales Stream in any other Hub under the same Uberflip account.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Content</strong> &gt; <strong>Streams tab </strong>&gt; <strong>New Stream </strong>and click on <strong>Vimeo </strong>again, as you did when you connected the Vimeo account.</li>\n<li>Because your Vimeo account is already connected, you'll now see the <strong>Add a Vimeo Stream</strong> screen<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/12994664135437\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2023-02-09_at_4.32.22_PM.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"223\">\n</li>\n<li>Under <strong><em>Create a Stream from</em></strong>, click the dropdown and choose what you want to import from your account</li>\n<li>After you've selected an option, click <strong>Import</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Uberflip will begin importing videos.

Learn about the Uberflip features you can use to build effective localized content experiences.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About Hub Localization</h2>\n<p>As of 2019, <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_language/ms/y\">over 55%</a> of content on the web was in English. But while English might be the dominant language on the web, you're missing out on a lot of potential customers if you're offering your content in English alone. In 2014, <a href=\"https://csa-research.com/More/Media/Press-Releases/ArticleID/31/Survey-of-3-000-Online-Shoppers-Across-10-Countries-Finds-that-60-Rarely-or-Never-Buy-from-English-only-Websites\">CSA Research</a> surveyed consumers across 10 non-Anglophone countries about their language preferences on the web. The survey found that:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>\n<strong>75%</strong> of those surveyed<strong> prefer to buy in their first language</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>60% </strong>would <strong>rarely or never buy from English-only websites</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>56% </strong>either<strong> spend more time on sites in their own language</strong>, or<strong> deliberately boycott English-language websites<br></strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, you'll never reach these potential customers with English-language content alone. That's why, if you want to maximize the reach and impact of your content, <strong>localization</strong> is essential.</p>\n<p>Uberflip has a suite of built-in tools and features that make it simple to localize your Hub content without the need to involve your IT team or other technical resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Language Hubs</strong> and <strong>Hub Locale </strong>to house localized content and set language HTML tags</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Custom Label Translations</strong> to translate navigation and other UI elements in a Hub</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Multi-Language Links </strong>to set hreflang HTML tags for international SEO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this article, we'll provide an overview of these features and how you can use them to localize your content in Uberflip.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_c47c28f3-0f35-4ab9-a4e7-1a50028bc25f\">Step 1: Create Language Hubs With Hub Locale</h2>\n<h3>Language Hubs</h3>\n<p>Localizing your Uberflip content starts with creating <strong>language Hubs</strong>. Uberflip's localization features are designed around using separate Hubs for each language or region you want to support. For example, say you wanted to offer your content in Spanish in addition to English. In this case, you'd have two Hubs: your original English-language Hub, and a Spanish-language Hub that contains the same content translated into Spanish.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"text-primary\">⇒</span></strong> If you want to add further Hubs to your Uberflip account, please <strong>contact your Customer Success Manager</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Can I have different languages in a single Hub?</h4>\n<p>In purely practical terms, yes: you're able to add content in different languages to a single Hub if you want. However, we <strong>don't recommend doing this</strong>, because you won't be able to take advantage of the other localization features, which rely on using separate Hubs for distinct languages/regions.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Hub Locale</h3>\n<p>The key Uberflip setting that enables language-specific Hubs (as well as all other localization features) is <strong>Hub Locale</strong>. This is a Hub-level setting that specifies the <strong>language and region</strong> of a Hub:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360042873472/Hubs___Options_-_Advanced_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Options_-_Advanced_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>Setting the Hub Locale is one of the first things you should do whenever you add a new Hub to your account. Primarily, it sets an HTML tag on the Hub that <strong>declares the Hub's language and region in a format that browsers and search engines can understand</strong>. Just as importantly, it works with other localization features to <a href=\"#h_875517a0-5a16-47d0-ab0e-20838b965547\" target=\"_self\">translate Hub UI labels</a> and <a href=\"#h_86bd467f-8d07-40f6-a6d4-90959b1f066d\" target=\"_self\">set the appropriate SEO tags</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"text-primary\">⇒</span></strong> To learn more about Hub Locale, including what it does and how to set or change it, see this article: <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020065732\"><strong>Hub Locale Explained</strong></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_875517a0-5a16-47d0-ab0e-20838b965547\">Step 2: Translate UI Elements With Custom Labels</h2>\n<p>Hubs contain all kinds of user interface text labels, such as headings, buttons, and so on. Once you have a Hub set up for a particular language, you need to make sure that the Hub interface is in that language as well.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Custom Labels</strong> feature makes this easy. Once you have set a <a href=\"#h_c47c28f3-0f35-4ab9-a4e7-1a50028bc25f\" target=\"_self\">Hub Locale</a>, Custom Labels will automatically translate all Hub interface text into the appropriate language. Pre-made translations are available for a number of widely-used languages (e.g. Simplified Chinese, Spanish, etc.). If a pre-made translation is not available for a language you want to support, adding the translations yourself is simple.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"text-primary\">⇒</span></strong> To learn more about <strong>Custom Labels</strong>, including which languages have pre-made translations and how to add your own, see this article: <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028690851\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Customize Hub Interface Text or Change Hub Language with Custom Labels</strong></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_86bd467f-8d07-40f6-a6d4-90959b1f066d\">Step 3: Set Hreflang Tags With Multi-Language Links</h2>\n<p>Lastly, one of the most important aspects of any localization project is SEO: ensuring that your localized content is being surfaced to people who are searching in that language, or who are in regions where that language is spoken.</p>\n<p>The primary SEO tool for localization is the <strong>hreflang tag</strong>, which is a type of HTML tag that Google and some other search engines look for. By setting hreflang tags on your pages, you can tell these search engines both which language a given page is in, and which <em>other</em> languages that page has been translated into. Using hreflang tags is an essential SEO best practice, because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>They help to surface your content in search results</strong>: When a search engine indexes your content and sees the hreflang tag, it knows that it can serve a translated version of the same content to people searching in a particular language. Since readers usually prefer content in their primary language, this also helps to improve their user experience with your content, and therefore increases their engagement.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>They allow you to avoid duplicate content issues</strong>: Sometimes, different localized versions of pages can look very similar to one another: for example, a page targeting a US audience and another targeting a UK audience might only have differences in spelling and things like currency symbols. In such cases, search engines may consider the pages to be duplicate content, and downrank them in search results. Placing an hreflang tag helps to avoid this, as it tells search engines that the two pages are actually alternates, not duplicates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The traditional downside to hreflang tags is that they need to be added individually to the HTML of every localized version of a page, which can be tedious and usually involves digging around in page code. However, in Uberflip it's easy to set hreflang tags with the <strong>Multi-Language Links</strong> feature. With Multi-Language Links, you can simply click-to-select pages that are localized versions of one another to \"link\" them together. Once linked, Uberflip automatically sets the appropriate hreflang tags on all of the pages (based on their applicable <a href=\"#h_c47c28f3-0f35-4ab9-a4e7-1a50028bc25f\" target=\"_self\">Hub Locales</a>) — no working with HTML required.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"text-primary\">⇒</span></strong> To learn more about <strong>Multi-Language Links</strong>, including related features such as the <strong>language selection menu</strong> and <strong>contextual linking</strong>, see this article: <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035196932\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Create Multi-Language Links Between Hubs, Streams, and Items</strong></a></p>"

For instructions, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022588451\">this article</a>.</li>\n<li>The Content Recommendations feature recommends content within your Hub. You can also also recommend content from your Hub on your other web properties with the separate <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022595791\">Site Engager</a> feature.</li>\n<li>Uberflip's recommendation engine is only available on certain pack types. Content Recommendations requires this, so if your pack type does not include it, this feature will not be available in your Hub. For more information about your pack type and what's included, please contact your Customer Success Manager, or Uberflip Support.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J04RMHD9TSC73EYAVWYW3SBR\">About Content Recommendations</h2>\n<p>Uberflip Content Recommendations is a content recommendation engine which can offer personalized suggestions to visitors as they browse your Hub. Using Content Recommendations can help you to surface content that's relevant to your visitors' interests, keeping them engaged with your content for longer.</p>\n<p>Content Recommendations must be customized to your visitors' needs and interests to be valuable, so we use the recommendation engine. This allows you to serve up the most relevant content for each individual visitor. Alternatively, you can also opt to manually define Streams from which to serve recommendations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J04RMHD98X4V6M0WEHZFFZDG\">Where Are Recommendations Shown?</h3>\n<p>Within your Hub, recommendations are always shown <strong>beside Items</strong>, and appear in two places. They are primarily served via the <strong>recommendation panel</strong>, a sidebar that appears on the left of the screen whenever a visitor views an Item:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019832112\" alt=\"Gating_Content__This_One_Small_Change_Will_7x_Your_Conversion_Rate___Uberflip.png\" width=\"588\" height=\"477\"></p>\n<p>If a device's screen is too small to to display the panel (or if you disable the panel), you can also place recommendations in the <em>More Content </em>carousel:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019831812\" alt=\"How_to_Use_The_Item_Management_Dashboard.png\" width=\"545\" height=\"239\"></p>\n<p>As well as in the <em>Next Item</em> flyout (if enabled):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019700231\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-01-30__11_26_AM.png\"></p>\n<p>In both cases, the recommendations will replace the actual next/previous Items in the Stream.</p>\n<p>Also, note that recommendations are never shown at the Stream level — only at the Item level.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J04RMHD96K8989ZH9DS37GX4\">Set Up Content Recommendations in Your Hub</h2>\n<p>Content Recommendations consists of two core components, which you use to configure the appearance and behavior of recommendations in your Hub:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Recommendation Templates</strong> determine how recommendations appear in your Hub. They allow you to define the look and feel of your recommendations, such as how many Items are recommended, how much time passes before the panel appears, etc.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Recommendation Rules</strong> define the placement and source of recommendations. In other words, they control where in your Hub a set of recommendations will be shown, and what content will be recommended. You can enable or disable individual rules, which allows you to control whether a specific recommendation setup is active (enabled) or inactive (disabled).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You use these components together to serve recommendations in your Hub: basically, you set up a Recommendation Rule to define the details of the recommendations (i.e. the \"what\" and the \"where\"), then assign a Recommendation Template to that rule to define look and feel. Finally, you enable the Recommendation Rule to actually begin serving the corresponding recommendations on the Hub.</p>\n<p>If you're setting up recommendations for the first time, we recommend that you begin by <a href=\"#h_4249929981061549314107420\">creating a Recommendation Template</a> (to set up the look and feel). You can then <a href=\"#h_7807057911371549314138895\">create your first Recommendation Rule</a> and use the template you set up with it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_4249929981061549314107420\">Manage Recommendation Templates</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J04RMHD900KWQ0R44GMYVPC3\">Create a Recommendation Template</h3>\n<p>You can create as many templates as you like for different purposes.

This is because the engine takes a little while to collect the data it needs to provide meaningful recommendations for visitors.</p>\n<p>Note that your Hub must have visitors in order for the recommendations to be generated. The recommendation engine also uses Bombora intent data, and Bombora likewise requires visitors to generate this data. If you only recently set up your <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022588451\">Bombora integration</a> and it has not yet collected enough visitor data, this means you won't see any engine recommendations yet.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J04RMHDAJ9KGZWB7NTJQTR0T\">Edit or Delete a Recommendation Rule</h3>\n<p>You can edit or delete rules at any time, even if they are currently enabled.

Click on <strong>OK</strong> to confirm the deletion.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J04RMHDA6RBTZCHHPTJFE6DC\">Set Recommendation Rule Order</h2>\n<p>You can set up Recommendation Rules in such a way that multiple rules can apply to a given Stream. In such cases, the order of your rules will determine which rule takes precedence and serves recommendations on Items in that Stream.</p>\n<p>To illustrate, consider this setup:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360020667252\" alt=\"Hubs___Recommendation_Rules_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"699\" height=\"154\"></p>\n<p>You can see in the parentheses beside the rule names which Stream(s) each rule applies to. Here's how it breaks down:</p>\n<table style=\"height: 246px;\" width=\"601\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"> </td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"><strong>Stream A</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"><strong>Stream B</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"><strong>Other Streams</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"><strong>Rule 1</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"><strong>•</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"><strong>•</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"><strong>•</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"><strong>Rule 2</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"><strong>•</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"> </td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"><strong>Rule 3</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"> </td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"><strong>•</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 147px;\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As you can see, Rule 2 is designed to apply to only Stream A, and Rule 3 is designed to apply to only Stream B. However, Rule 1 is an All Streams rule, so it <em>also</em> applies to both Stream A and Stream B. This creates a conflict with the other rules.</p>\n<p>To resolve the conflict, we can adjust the rule order to determine priority. When ordering conflicting rules, you want the rule with the <em>narrowest</em> scope to have the highest priority. That way, a rule scoped to just one Stream will only apply to that Stream, while more widely-scoped rules will apply to all  Streams that don't have their own rule.</p>\n<p>In this case, we can just bump Rules 2 and 3 above Rule 1 in the order, like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360020672332\" alt=\"Hubs___Recommendation_Rules_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>Now, Rule 2 takes priority over Rule 1 for Stream A, and Rule 3 takes priority over Rule 1 for Stream B. For all Streams <em>other</em> than A and B, Rule 1 will apply. (Note that the order of Rules 2 and 3 relative to one another doesn't matter, as they do not conflict.)</p>\n<p>To modify the order of Recommendation Rules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>While viewing your list of Recommendation Rules (<strong>Recommendations &gt; Recommendation Rules</strong>), find the rule you want to reorder.</li>\n<li>Click on the number in the <strong>Order</strong> column for the rule:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360020788532\" alt=\"Hubs___Recommendation_Rules_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Type in the new position</strong> in the order where you want this rule to appear (or use the arrow buttons), then press <strong>Enter</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360020788792\" alt=\"Hubs___Recommendation_Rules_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The rule will be moved to the chosen position in the order, and the other rules in the list will be automatically reordered to accommodate the change (i.e. they will be shifted up or down the order by one position as needed):<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360020711691\" alt=\"Hubs___Recommendation_Rules_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01J04RMHDAC6C6CGRPJ8MH7SNJ\" class=\"callout__title\">Best Practice: The \"Catch All\" Recommendation Rule</h4>\n<p>We recommend creating a \"Catch All\" Recommendation Rule to serve recommendations anywhere that no Stream-specific rule exists.

Although the maximum character limit for taglines is 150, the <em>practical</em> limit may be lower if you use longer words, because they cannot be broken up across lines as efficiently. In other words, some very long taglines may still \"slide under\" the button even at the lowest font size setting.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Only the tagline font size can be changed: the button text font is a fixed size, and can't be adjusted.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Background Image</h3>\n<p>If you want, you can use a background image instead of a solid background color.

To understand whether this option will work for you, you should have some familiarity with how your website hosting is set up, or have access to a resource who can help you get the necessary information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About Hosting Your Hub on a Subdirectory</h2>\n<p>If you want to use a custom domain with your Uberflip Hub, there are two options: you can host your Hub on a <strong>subdirectory</strong>, or on a <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018786372\"><strong>subdomain</strong></a>. </p>\n<p>This article will provide an overview of the setup process if you have chosen to use the <strong>subdirectory</strong> option. In other words, it will explain how you can make your Hub accessible under a URL that looks something like <em>www.mycompany.com</em>/<em>resources</em>.</p>\n<p>Compared to using a subdomain, the process for using a subdirectory to host your Hub is significantly more technical in nature. To explain how it works and how to set it up, we will need to look at web server technology and related concepts. That said, <strong>this article is specifically intended for a non-technical audience</strong>, so people with no technical background should be able to follow along without difficulty.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Why Hubs on Subdirectories Are More Complex</h2>\n<p>Although the actual setup processes for subdirectories and subdomains are completely different, these are really just different ways of achieving the same goal. In both cases, what we are doing is serving up a Hub as if it's part of your website, even though it's hosted on Uberflip's servers. So why are subdirectories more complicated to set up?</p>\n<p>When you go the subdomain route, we're able to take advantage of a web feature called <strong>CNAME record</strong> to achieve our goal. This quite literally makes it look like you're visiting one website while you're actually getting the content from another website. It's a function that's ready-made to do exactly what we need it to do, and it's very easy to set up.</p>\n<p>The problem is, CNAME records only work on subdomains — they can't be used with subdirectories. So if you want your Hub's URL to look like <em>www.mycompany.com/resources</em> (rather than <em>resources.mycompany.com</em>), an alternative solution is required. To host your Hub on a subdirectory, you need to use a <strong>reverse</strong> <strong>proxy</strong> instead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What a Reverse Proxy Does</h2>\n<p>To understand what a reverse proxy does, we first need to look at what's happening under the hood when you visit a website. In a nutshell, a <em>client</em> (i.e. a user visiting a webpage with their browser) sends a <em>request </em>over the web to a <em>server</em>, and the server retrieves the requested <em>resource </em>(i.e. the webpage and all the content on it) and sends it back to the client.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360015238652/Client-Server_Diagram.png\" alt=\"Client-Server_Diagram.png\" width=\"479\" height=\"124\"></p>\n<p>This system can also contain other elements, like <em>proxies</em>. A proxy (technically a <em>proxy server</em>, but we'll just say proxy for short) is an intermediary that sits between the client and the server. At the most basic level, a proxy takes requests from the client and sends them on to the server, then takes the resources returned by the server and passes them back to the client.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360015285811/Client-Proxy-Server_Diagram.png\" alt=\"Client-Proxy-Server_Diagram.png\" width=\"628\" height=\"139\"></p>\n<p>Proxies can be used by either clients or servers. When a proxy is used by a server, it's called a <strong><em>reverse proxy</em></strong>. This is the type we're interested in, because a reverse proxy can pass requests to more than one server, and can <em>selectively</em> send requests to <em>different servers</em> based on certain criteria.</p>\n<p>This ability to route incoming requests is useful, because it means you can use it to direct requests for a subdirectory the same way you'd use a CNAME record on a subdomain. All you have to do is set up a reverse proxy in front of your web server, then create a rule on it that says: \"pass through all other traffic to my regular server, but whenever you get a request for this specific subdirectory, send it to Uberflip's servers instead\".</p>\n<p>The result is that for all regular traffic to your website (i.e. if someone asks for any page other than your Hub's subdirectory), the proxy simply sends the requests through to your normal servers:<br><br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360015239572/Normal_Request_Diagram.png\" alt=\"Normal_Request_Diagram.png\" width=\"701\" height=\"353\"></p>\n<p>But whenever a request comes in for the particular subdirectory where your Hub lives (e.g. <em>mycompany.com/resources</em>), the proxy sends it to Uberflip's server, which seamlessly returns your Hub content to the client:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360015239552/Hub_Request_Diagram.png\" alt=\"Hub_Request_Diagram.png\" width=\"701\" height=\"357\"></p>\n<p>As far as the client is concerned, they went to <em>mycompany.com/resources</em> and got your Hub — they have no idea that it came from a different server than all the other pages on your website. And there it is: with the help of a reverse proxy, we can make it look like your Hub is part of your website.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Implementing a Reverse Proxy</h2>\n<p>Here's where things get a little more complicated. So far, we've looked at how it all works in the abstract, but in more practical terms, there are actually several different ways to use a reverse proxy with your website.</p>\n<p>Let's begin by taking a general look at the two main ways you can implement a reverse proxy:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Option 1: Proxy Server/Load Balancer or Reverse Proxy Module</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is: </strong>As we described above, a <em>reverse proxy</em> <em>server</em> is a server that sits between the web and one or more web servers. It takes client requests and forwards them on to the web server(s), then returns the responses to the clients.</p>\n<p>A <em>load balancer</em> is simply a specific type of reverse proxy. The term refers to a particular application where the reverse proxy is used to distribute the workload of high-traffic websites between multiple servers.</p>\n<p>A reverse proxy can also be implemented as part of the main web server, usually in the form of a <em>module</em>. The effect is exactly the same as having a dedicated reverse proxy server; the only difference is that it's part of the web server, rather than a separate entity.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works with your Hub: </strong>With a reverse proxy in place (whether it's implemented as a separate system, a load balancer, or an integrated module), you can configure it to route certain requests to specific servers, i.e. requests for your Hub subdirectory to Uberflip's server.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong>Commonly used reverse proxies/load balancers are <em>HAProxy</em> and <em>NGINX</em>. An example of a reverse proxy module on a web server is <em>mod_proxy</em> on Apache HTTP Server.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Option 2: Content Delivery Network (CDN)</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is: </strong>A <em>Content Delivery Network</em> is a service which maintains a network of proxy servers in various geographic locations, and can deliver your website to a client from any of those servers. There are various use cases for CDNs, but the most common one is based on the idea that a website will generally load faster when the server is physically closer to the client. By making sure there is a server fairly close to any possible client, CDNs can optimize load times for the websites they deliver.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works with your Hub: </strong>At its heart, a CDN is essentially a network of proxy servers. So, like any reverse proxy, most offer the ability to selectively route route requests.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Major CDNs include <em>Amazon CloudFront</em>, <em>Akamai</em>, <em>Cloudflare (Enterprise)</em>, <em>Limelight</em>, etc.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Which Reverse Proxy Option Should I Choose?</h2>\n<p>The bottom line is that you need to implement a reverse proxy of some sort. How you choose to do this will depend on your specific circumstances, and we can't provide a definitive, one-size-fits-all answer.</p>\n<p>However, this is our general recommendation: if you <strong>don't currently have reverse proxy functionality</strong> on your web server, <strong>use a CDN</strong>. Here's why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>It's simple: </strong>With no other reverse proxy functionality currently in place, it's typically the simplest of the options to add to your web hosting setup.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>It works: </strong>We have experience with using a CDN for this purpose (CloudFront, specifically), and we know it works well.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>It's faster:</strong> By their nature, CDN servers are virtually always located closer to any given client than your own servers, and in most cases can offer faster load times for your Hub than a proxy server.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cost: </strong>Some CDNs offer a free service tier, so if your website is below a certain amount of volume, using a CDN may come at no extra cost. (For example, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/free/\">CloudFront's free tier</a> includes 50 GB data transfer and 2 million requests per month.) By comparison, adding a dedicated reverse proxy to your web server would likely be more expensive.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Additional benefits: </strong>Aside from allowing you to host your Uberflip Hub on a subdirectory, you also get the primary benefits of using a CDN with your website, including generally faster load times for end users, load balancing, DDoS attack protection, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We strongly recommend going with a CDN if you want to host your Hub on a subdirectory, but that doesn't mean you <em>have</em> to use one. If you do already have some type of reverse proxy functionality in place, you can certainly leverage that instead.</p>\n<p>To help make your decision, here are some questions to ask your website/technical team:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Does our web server use a load balancer or reverse proxy server like HAProxy or NGINX?\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Yes: </strong>You can consider using it to direct requests for your Hub subdirectory.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No</strong><strong>: </strong>Proceed to next question.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Does our web server have reverse proxy/gateway capabilities such as Apache's mod_proxy (or equivalent)?\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Yes: </strong>You can consider using it to direct requests for your Hub subdirectory.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No</strong><strong>: </strong>Proceed to next question.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Do we use a CDN with our website?<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Yes: </strong>Use your existing CDN to direct requests for your Hub subdirectory.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No</strong><strong>: </strong>Add a CDN to your web hosting setup.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Still not sure whether you should use a subdirectory custom domain?

Which URL should you allow search engines to index?</p>\n<p>There is no one <em>right</em> answer to this question — it depends on your preference. But whichever option you choose, the most important thing is to make sure only <strong>one</strong> of these options is indexed.</p>\n<p>The majority of Uberflip customers choose to index the Source Stream URLs, then allow user navigation to the Marketing Stream versions by way of the user's interest. This option is the most popular because it's the simplest to set up. However, the big value of Marketing Streams is that you can present your content not just by type, but by topic/audience/campaign/product etc. So, if you want, indexing the Marketing Stream version of any given Item is also possible.</p>\n<p>Because an Item can live in multiple Marketing Streams, you will need to pick which Marketing Stream URL you want indexed if you choose to go this route. This will require some manual effort: for each Item that you want indexed on a Marketing Stream rather than the Source Stream, you will need to edit that Item and set the Canonical URL field to be the Marketing Stream version's URL.  This ensures that in any Stream in which the Item appears (Source or Marketing), the canonical meta tag will reference your chosen Marketing Stream version.</p>\n<p>One thing to specifically <strong>avoid</strong> in this scenario is to have an Item placed in multiple Marketing Streams which all have <strong>both</strong> the Enable Canonical Meta Tag option <strong>and </strong>the Force Self-Canonical URL option turned <strong>on. </strong>This tells search engines that all versions of the same content on different URLs should be indexed separately, which is considered duplicate content and has negative SEO effects.</p>\n<p>In a scenario where you are combining multiple blog feeds/Streams into a single Marketing Blog Stream that you would want indexed, here is what you should do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your Source Streams have the <strong>No Robots Meta Tag</strong> option turned <strong>on</strong>\n</li>\n<li>On the \"main\" Marketing Stream, make sure both the <strong>Enable Canonical Meta Tag</strong> and <strong>Force Self-Canonical URL </strong>options are turned <strong>on</strong>\n</li>\n<li>On all other Marketing Streams where the Items will also live (and, ideally, on the external source blog), edit each Item to set the canonical URLs as the URLs of the Items in the main Marketing Stream</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By doing the above, you will avoid a duplicate content scenario, while also using the other Marketing Streams and the external source blog to drive SEO value to the main Marketing Stream.</p>"

We won't go into detail on how to use or configure Custom Code in this article, so you should have an understanding of how to work with the Custom Code feature before you proceed. To learn how to use the Custom Code feature, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Add HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to your Hub with Custom Code</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H98R53CFZVS8P0A6KG61NF68\">About animated CTA background images</h2>\n<p>In this article, you'll learn how to create an \"animated CTA\" by setting a GIF to be the CTA's background image. When displayed in your Hub, the background animation will play in a loop, creating an eye-catching CTA that stands out from your Item tiles.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360031424292\" alt=\"Kapture_2019-06-19_at_12.38.43.gif\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H98R53CF76GEXC7RX7MPHNVZ\">Setup</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01H98R53CFYTDRWP676VZEP51A\">Prepare the CTA and get its ID</h3>\n<p>Begin by getting the <strong>CTA ID </strong>of the CTA to which you want to apply an animated background.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, navigate to the <strong>Calls-to-Action</strong> section in your Hub and <strong>click on the CTA</strong> to open it. The CTA ID for the selected CTA will be shown beside its title, near the top of the screen:<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4405167714317\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>While editing the CTA, make sure to <strong>remove any existing background image </strong>(if present) in the <strong>Design</strong> <strong>tab</strong> of the CTA editor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01H98R53CFMHZT936BVWWQ3J5D\">Get the animated GIF</h3>\n<p>You'll also need to prepare the <strong>animated GIF</strong> that you want to use as the background for the CTA. The background must meet these requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be an <strong>animated</strong> <strong>GIF</strong> image (i.e. an animated image file with the file extension .gif)</li>\n<li>Be <strong>1.5 MB or smaller</strong> in size</li>\n<li>Be <strong>exactly </strong><strong>330 px tall</strong> by <strong>250 px wide</strong> (you won't be able to resize the image in Uberflip as you can with a normal CTA background image)</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H98R53CFH2QAAPKV3RF6J30D\">Step 1: Upload the animated GIF</h2>\n<p>The first thing you need to do is upload the animated GIF to your Hub using the Image Manager and get its URL.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Hub.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Images</strong> in the left sidebar menu to open the Image Manager.</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Upload</strong> button.</li>\n<li>Choose the animated GIF that you want to use and upload it. You'll be returned to the Image Manager, and the GIF you just uploaded should appear at the top of the list.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Copy the URL </strong>from the URL field for the animated GIF you just uploaded and make a note of it, as you'll need it again in a moment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H98R53CF1EF3THY8JFMW7SHC\">Step 2: Set up the custom code block</h2>\n<p>The next step is to set up a custom code block that will insert the animated GIF as the background image of the CTA, and enter the code snippet that makes it work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01H98R53CFBB2XK6S5Q8M3QAXG\">Create or choose a custom code block</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>In your Hub, click on <strong>Appearance &gt; Custom </strong><strong>Code</strong> and either add a new custom code block (with any name/description of your choice), or edit an existing block.</li>\n<li>Set the placement of the code block to <strong>Head</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong> Add one of the code snippets</strong><strong> below</strong> to the custom code block.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"h_01H98R53CF3WDJMD9ACZEDBJSV\">Add the custom code snippet</h3>\n<p>You'll need to choose the appropriate code snippet based on the version of the <strong>Uberflip Hub Front End</strong> that your Hub is using.

These parameters bolded in the code snippets above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For <strong>[CTA ID GOES HERE]</strong>, insert the numerical <strong>CTA ID</strong> for the CTA to which you want to add the animated background. Do not include the square brackets.\n<ul>\n<li>Example: <code class=\"no-padding\">123456</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For <strong>[URL GOES HERE]</strong>, insert the <strong>URL for the animated GIF</strong> that you copied from the Image Manager earlier. Do not include the square brackets.\n<ul>\n<li>Example: <code class=\"no-padding\">url('https://content.cdntwrk.com/files/myanimatedgif.gif')</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\" id=\"h_01H98R53CGQ0NM55S8MDB53HDZ\">Note</h4>\n<p>Remember that each individual code snippet will add an animated background to <strong>one</strong> <strong>CTA only</strong> (the one you specify by its CTA ID). To add animated backgrounds to additional CTAs, you will need to add further instances of the code snippet to your custom code block, configured with the appropriate CTA IDs and URLs.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01H98R53CGVDMNB08DXADBRADK\">Save and enable the custom code block</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Finally, click on the <strong>Save</strong> button to save your custom code block.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Enable Custom Code</strong>, switch the toggle button to the <strong>on (green) </strong>position to enable the code snippet on your Hub.</li>\n<li>Your changes will take effect immediately, and you can test it by simply viewing any Stream in which the CTA has been placed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H98R53CGYCD4WD0612CVYQ78\">Additional Notes</h2>\n<p>If you prefer, you can also host the animated GIF externally. In this case, simply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Skip</strong> <em>Step 1: Upload the animated GIF</em>.</li>\n<li>In <em>Step 2: Set up the custom code block</em>, insert the <strong>external</strong> <strong>URL where the animated GIF is hosted</strong> into the code snippet (for <strong>[URL GOES HERE]</strong>).</li>\n</ul>"

In general:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Impressions</strong> tells you how many of your recommendations are actually being seen by visitors</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Clicks</strong> indicates how relevant your visitors found those recommendations based on how much they actually engaged with them</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Form CTA conversions</strong> gives you an idea of how effective the recommendations are at converting visitors into prospects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, this is a funnel: impressions lead to clicks, which in turn lead to conversions. This is represented by the arrows with percentages above them that appear between each of the tiles:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360024342812\" alt=\"Hubs___Recommendation_Performance_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"376\" height=\"165\"></p>\n<p>These figures represent the <strong>conversion rate</strong> between the metrics, i.e. the proportion of the metric on the left that converted into the one on the right. In the screenshot above, for instance, you can see that out of 335 visitors who clicked through on a recommendation, 17 submitted a Form CTA — a conversion rate of 5.07%. Conversion rates visualize the relationship between the metrics, and are useful for seeing at a glance how \"efficient\" your recommendations are at turning your visitors into prospects.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_fa04d3a5-c539-45c6-879b-c3c862d9aa79\" class=\"callout__title\">What counts as an impression?</h4>\n<p>An <strong>impression</strong> is counted each time a recommendation is seen by a visitor. This means that the recommendation must be actually visible to the visitor to be counted: only Items that are <strong>fully rendered onscreen in the visitor's browser</strong> count as an impression.</p>\n<p>For example, in the screenshot below, the top Item would count as an impression, but the bottom Item would not, because it is cut off (not fully visible):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360024358111\" alt=\"5_Content_Distribution_Channels_for_Your_ABM_Program__cheat_sheet____Uberflip_and_Reference__Custom_Zendesk_Formatting_Components___Uberflip_Help.png\" width=\"324\" height=\"362\"></p>\n<p>We also have built-in error correction that will record an impression if an Item registers a click-through without a corresponding impression. For example, if a visitor clicked on the bottom Item in the screenshot above, this would increase the click count but not the impression count, so an impression is automatically recorded in this situation to prevent a discrepancy.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Item-Level and Rules-Level Metrics Explained</h2>\n<p>You can also view these same metrics (impressions, clicks, and Form CTA conversions) broken down by individual Items and recommendation rules. These more granular metrics are shown in the tables below the Overview Metrics section under the <strong>Items</strong> and <strong>Rules</strong> tabs:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360024420951\" alt=\"Hubs___Recommendation_Performance_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"464\" height=\"401\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Item-Level Metrics</h3>\n<p>This table breaks down impressions, clicks and Form CTA conversions (along with conversion rates between them) by individual Items that were recommended to visitors. All metrics shown reflect the currently selected date range and filters.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360024409812\" alt=\"Hubs___Recommendation_Performance_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"703\" height=\"120\"></p>\n<p>By default, the table is sorted in descending order by impressions (i.e. the Item with the most impressions at the top). You can sort the table by any of the available metrics by clicking on its column header, including the <em>conversion rate</em> columns between each of the metrics. The column currently used for sorting is highlighted and has an arrow beside it to indicate the sort order (click a column header once for descending, and click it a second time for ascending):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360024409872\" alt=\"Hubs___Recommendation_Performance_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>You can get some useful insights by sorting the table in various ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Items with a lot of impressions are recommended frequently, but this doesn't necessarily mean that they're effective — look at their conversion rates to the other metrics to identify how you might improve them. Items that are recommended a lot tend to be the ones that are the best fit for your visitors' interests, so if you are seeing an Item of this type with relatively few clicks, this can be a signal that you need to improve its title and/or thumbnail.</li>\n<li>Items with a lot of clicks, especially relative to impressions, are grabbing the attention of your visitors. These Items are worth analyzing to see what makes them so appealing, as you may be able to apply what you learn to your other content as well.</li>\n<li>Items with a lot of Form CTA conversions relative to clicks are your high-performers. To get the most out of them, you want to get these Items in front of as many visitors as possible, so look at impressions and clicks to see where you can improve.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Rules-Level Metrics</h3>\n<p>This table breaks down impressions, clicks and Form CTA conversions (along with conversion rates between them) by the specific recommendation rules that you have set up. All metrics shown reflect the currently selected date range and filters.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360024425991\" alt=\"Hubs___Recommendation_Performance_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"104\"></p>\n<p>By default, the table is sorted in descending order by impressions (i.e. the rule that generated the most impressions at the top). As with the Item-level metrics table, you can click on a column header to sort the table by that metric, and the sorting column is highlighted with an arrow indicating sort order. This includes the <em>conversion </em><em>rate</em> columns between the metrics, but does not include the <em>Location</em> column, which can't be sorted (use filters instead).</p>\n<p>The Rules-level metrics are helpful for understanding the effectiveness of your different recommendation rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a rule is generating a lot of impressions, don't assume that it must be working: this might simply be because it is widely deployed, and doesn't mean it's actually effective. Look for rules that have a lot of impressions but a relatively low number of clicks (i.e. a low conversion rate from impressions to clicks). These rules are showing Items a lot, but the low clickthrough rate can indicate that these Items may not be appealing or relevant to most visitors who see them, so the rule may need to be tweaked.</li>\n<li>If some of your rules are narrowly targeted on purpose, you would not expect them to generate many impressions. However, because of their narrow focus, you could generally expect them to have a higher click-through rate than the average, widely-scoped rule. For this type of rule, look for instances with a low clickthrough rate to identify opportunities for improvement. You can also look at similar rules which are more effective to see what you can learn from them.</li>\n<li>Make sure to also look for rules that are generating few or no impressions. If they aren't being seen, this could be due to a setup problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Export Recommendation Metrics</h2>\n<p>If you want to slice-and-dice these metrics further, you can export the raw data and import it into an external data analysis tool or data warehouse. The exported data is available in CSV format, which most tools of this kind support as an import option.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>As the Recommendation Dashboard doesn't support date ranges longer than 1 month, you can use the CSV export instead: simply export the previous month's data each month, which will allow you to view data over longer time periods in your external data analysis tool.</p>\n</div>\n<p>To export data, click on the <strong>Export CSV</strong> button on the right side of the filter menu bar:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360024356651\" alt=\"Hubs___Recommendation_Performance_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"663\" height=\"138\"></p>\n<p>This will generate and automatically start downloading a CSV file with a file name in the format <em>Recommendations - Account XXXXXX - Hub XXX - YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD.csv</em>:</p>\n<p><em><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360024339592\" alt=\"Hubs___Recommendation_Performance_-_Uberflip_and_Downloads_and_Documentation_Prep_-_Recomendation_Dashboard_-_Google_Docs.png\"></em></p>\n<p>The export feature will apply the selected date range and all selected filters at the time the <strong>Export CSV</strong> button is clicked to the exported file.</p>"

Here are a few questions you can ask to help you decide.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Before You Begin</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This article assumes you already know about <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018876192\">custom domains and your options for implementing one</a>, and are considering the <strong>subdirectory </strong>option.</li>\n<li>We'll also assume that you understand <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018964792\">how the subdirectory option works</a>, and why it's more technically challenging to implement than the default option (<a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018786372\">subdomain</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Is a Subdirectory Custom Domain Right for Me?</h2>\n<p>So you've read all about <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018964792\">how subdirectory custom domains work</a>, and are now wondering if you should use one. In other words: is the additional complexity, setup effort, and (in some cases) cost worth it?</p>\n<p>To help you decide whether a subdirectory custom domain is the right option for your particular situation, here are some questions you can ask that might clarify the answer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>How important is it to have your Hub on a subdirectory?</h3>\n<p>This is the fundamental question: do you absolutely <em>need</em> your Hub to be on a subdirectory?</p>\n<p>An important thing to consider is whether external factors will influence this decision. For example, perhaps it's already been decided that all your digital properties must live on a subdirectory of your top-level domain. This could be for SEO or technical reasons, or even due to factors like security policies or regulatory compliance. Whatever the reason, under these circumstances you would of course have to explore using a subdirectory custom domain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Does it align with your go-to-market strategy?</h3>\n<p>Think about how your company goes to market. Do you have separate lines of business, products, or geographic regions that you operate in? If your company has a single brand, this could be a compelling reason to have all your content live under that top-level domain. In this case, a subdirectory custom domain would be the appropriate choice.</p>\n<p>Conversely, if you have multiple brands, using subdomains can help create a creater distinction between them than using subdirectories. Often SEO is given as a catch-all argument against using subdomains, but even Google uses them this way: their Google Ads brand, for example, lives at <a href=\"https://ads.google.com\">https://ads.google.com</a>.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>What kinds of content will you host on your Hub?</h3>\n<p>Consider your content. Is it directly related to the messaging and purpose of your top-level website? Or could it benefit from having its own unique destination?</p>\n<p>To illustrate the difference, here are two examples from Uberflip's own Hubs. On the one hand, we have our <strong>Culture Hub</strong>: we think of this as an extension of our company identity, so to emphasize this connection, we host it on a subdirectory at <a href=\"https://www.uberflip.com/culture\">https://www.uberflip.com/culture</a>. On the other hand, there is our <strong>Resource Hub</strong>, which has a much broader scope: it focuses on best practices around content experience for the industry as a whole. As a result, it lives on its own subdomain at <a href=\"https://hub.uberflip.com/\">https://hub.uberflip.com/</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>What are your brand preferences?</h3>\n<p>To many marketers, the structure of a domain is important simply from a brand and aesthetics perspective. Putting everything under one subdirectory allows you to keep everything tied under that one top level domain and brand. Think about where you and your team fall on this question. Is this a factor for you?</p>\n<p>It could well turn out that you have strong feelings on this matter: maybe a subdirectory just looks and feels more <em>right</em> for your brand than a subdomain does. This is as valid a reason to choose a subdirectory as any other, so make sure to take it into consideration as you make your decision.</p>"

Streams that were deleted prior to this date were removed permanently, and can't be restored.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About recovering deleted Items and archived Streams</h2>\n<p>It happens: you deleted an Item that you didn't mean to delete. Or maybe you archived a Stream and then realized you still needed it. Fortunately, there's an easy fix for both situations.</p>\n<p>When you delete an Item, Uberflip actually <strong>archives</strong> the Item, which involves removing it from all Streams and hiding it from the Hub. This means that you can view a list of all deleted Items at any time, and recover a deleted Item with a single click.</p>\n<p>It's similar for Streams: archiving a Stream doesn't delete it, and instead just hides it from your Hub. Archiving a Source Stream also archives the Items it contains, while archiving a Marketing Stream will hide only the Stream itself. As with Items, you can see a list of archived Streams, and restore any of them with a click (provided you have not yet hit your Stream limit).</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Limits on Recovering Items</h4>\n<p>You can recover a deleted Item <strong>until its Source Stream reaches the maximum number of Items </strong>(e.g. 5000 Items for Blog Streams). Once a Source Stream reaches this limit, the oldest active (non-deleted) Items in the Stream will be purged from the Stream to make room for new Items as they are created. Deleted Items do not count towards the limit (and are not automatically purged).

If you're familiar with terms like <em>Superuser</em>, <em>Superadmin</em> or <em>Account Owner </em>from other tools, you can think of the Primary User as being the Uberflip equivalent.</p>\n<p>The Primary User is special because they're the only user who can access certain parts of the Account Settings menu. No other type of user can access these settings, nor can they be given permission to access them — including users in the Account Administrators group.</p>\n<p>The settings which only Primary Users can access are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>Billing Details &amp; Invoices</em> section in the <em>Account </em>menu</li>\n<li>The <em>Services</em> section, which covers custom domain settings</li>\n<li>The <em>Integration </em>section, which covers the management of <em>API Credentials, Connected Services </em>and<em> Custom Integrations</em>\n</li>\n<li>The <em>Security</em> section, which covers the management of account security policies and <em>Single-Sign On (SSO)</em> settings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While you can't switch Primary User status from one user profile to another, you can change who within your organization is assigned to the Primary User profile.

CTAs are an essential marketing tool, which is why they're also an integral part of Uberflip. While your pages allow you to showcase your content and create great experiences around it, CTAs are how you leverage that content to generate leads and drive conversions.</p>\n<p>Most commonly, CTAs on the web come in the form of banners, buttons, and forms. In Uberflip, we combine these concepts to present CTAs as a specialty tile. They look similar to Item tiles, but encourage the user to either fill out a form or click a link.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/22332163332621\" width=\"483\" height=\"380\"><br>CTA tiles are designed to be eye-catching: they have bold graphics and colors, a large tagline, and a prominent button or text field to indicate that visitors can interact with them.</p>\n<p>There are <strong>two types of CTA tiles:</strong> Form CTAs and Link CTAs. <strong>This article outlines Form CTAs specifically</strong>, but if you want to learn more about Link CTAs, check out: <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020683852\">Link CTAs explained</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHJM08CBJ4SKFDRQR4WR7K0Y\">How do Form CTA tiles work?</h2>\n<p>Form CTA tiles look similar to Item tiles at first glance, but Form CTA Tiles differ in how visitors interact with them, how they can be styled, and how they are placed.</p>\n<p><strong>Form CTAs </strong>prompted action is to <strong>fill out a form</strong>.

The additional fields only become visible when a visitor interacts with a Form CTA, and are displayed on a second \"page\" (which also scrolls to accommodate all fields):<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/22332099809933\" width=\"213\" height=\"281\"><br>You can also enable <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021016412\"><strong>progressive profiling</strong></a>, which automatically hides any fields that a known visitor (as identified by a cookie) has previously completed. </p>\n<p>For example, if they had earlier signed up for your newsletter and provided their name and email address at that time, those fields would be hidden from any other Form CTAs they interact with (and automatically filled in on the backend).</p>\n<p>Lastly, <strong>Form CTAs can also have fields that are optional</strong>, so that visitors can choose not to complete them. Or, you can <strong>make fields conditional</strong>, so they are displayed only if certain conditions are met. This allows you to present different fields to different visitors based on their inputs: for example, you could present additional fields to visitors from the EU, which is useful for GDPR compliance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHJM08CBZPE8RRBATR2P4K0V\">What do I use Form CTAs for? </h2>\n<p>Form CTAs are essentially a kind of registration form, like the kind you would find on a landing page, and are designed to collect information from a visitor. Form CTAs can contain just a single field (such as for an email address), or can serve a full multi-field form that collects all kinds of information.</p>\n<p>Form CTAs can be used for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gating content </li>\n<li>Gathering newsletter subscribers</li>\n<li>Event registration</li>\n<li>Demo booking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Or anything else you'd want to gather visitor info for.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHJM08CBG68W2NJCDD4GHYPZ\">Where does the visitor information go?</h2>\n<p>Form CTA data is sent directly to your <strong>Marketing Automation Platform</strong> (MAP) through your <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020907752-Get-started-with-Uberflip-s-built-in-integrations\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">MAP integration</span></a> set up in Uberflip.

The following permissions control the ability to add custom URLs: <strong><em>View Hubs &gt; Manage Items &amp; Hub Settings</em></strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About custom URL paths (\"vanity URLs\")</h2>\n<p>When you create a new Stream or Item in your Hub, Uberflip automatically creates a URL for the resulting page. This URL will consist of your Hub's base URL, followed by a <strong>URL path</strong> formed from the Stream or Item's title. For example, Uberflip's own Hub has a Stream with the title <strong>Newsroom Articles</strong>, so the resulting URL is:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hub.uberflip.com/newsroom-articles\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">https://hub.uberflip.com/newsroom-articles</a></p>\n<p>Within that Stream, we've added an Item with the title <strong>Uberflip launches content experience certifications to help marketers master the acceleration of pipeline and revenue from demand programs</strong>, so the full URL for that page is:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hub.uberflip.com/newsroom-articles/uberflip-launches-content-experience-certifications-to-help-marketers-master-the-acceleration-of-pipeline-and-revenue-from-demand-programs\">https://hub.uberflip.com/newsroom-articles/uberflip-launches-content-experience-certifications-to-help-marketers-master-the-acceleration-of-pipeline-and-revenue-from-demand-programs</a></p>\n<p>As you can see, the default URL for an Item like this is incredibly long. In cases where you don't have enough space for a URL this long (or if you simply want a shorter, snappier URL), you can <strong>add a custom URL path</strong> and use that instead.</p>\n<p>Custom URL paths, or \"vanity URLs\", allow you to add <strong>alternative valid URLs</strong> to Streams or Items by specifying a new URL path of your choice. For instance, say we wanted to shorten the URL of the Item above. All we need to do is add a new URL path for, say, <em>/content-experience-certifications</em>, and we get a new URL that points to the same Item like this:<em><br></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hub.uberflip.com/newsroom-articles/uberflip-launches-content-experience-certifications-to-help-marketers-master-the-acceleration-of-pipeline-and-revenue-from-demand-programs\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">https://hub.uberflip.com/newsroom-articles/content-experience-certifications</a></p>\n<p>Custom URL paths don't <em>replace</em> the default URL for a Stream or Item — they're simply <em>added on</em> as another way to get to the same page, so the original URL (and all links to it) continues to work.</p>\n<h2>Add a custom URL path to an Item</h2>\n<p>You can add custom URL paths to any type of Item. You can add as many custom URL paths as needed — however, all custom URL paths must be unique (two Items cannot share the same URL path).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to <strong>app.uberflip.com</strong> and use the <strong>Hubs</strong> menu to select the Hub you want to work with.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Content</strong> in the sidebar menu.</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Items tab</strong> on the right.</li>\n<li>Find the Item for which you want to add a custom URL path and <strong>click on the Item </strong>to open it in the Item Editor.</li>\n<li>While viewing the Item in the Item Editor, click on the <strong>Metadata tab</strong>.</li>\n<li>Find the <strong>URL Path</strong> field:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4403566033677/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Enter the new URL path</strong> you want to add into the field, then press <strong>Enter</strong> (or click anywhere outside the field). Your new URL path will be added and will be active immediately. In addition, the previous URL path will appear underneath the field and will also remain active:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4403566064653/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>All URL paths that are listed both in and below the <strong>URL Path</strong> field are currently active, and can be used to access this Item. You can also <strong>remove a previous URL path</strong> (including the original default URL path) by <strong>clicking on the x beside it</strong>, which will remove it and deactivate it immediately:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4403566077325/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Additional notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The most recently added URL path for Items will appear in the URL Path field, and will be the <strong>primary URL path</strong>.

You can assume if a template setting is not listed below, it’s simply non-applicable and it doesn’t matter what you set it to for this embed widget. Here’s what does matter:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Display Options:</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<strong>Max.

That’s the beauty - you can use this embed instead, and get the benefit of both tiles and a viewer. That said, you </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">could</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> use both - at your own risk :) The only obvious issue is if you enable exit intent, they’ll both fire at the same time.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I set this up to display multiple widgets on one page?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, you can only display the widget in a single location on any given page. This is a system limitation, because the widget is driven by Site Engager rules, and Site Engager only allows for one rule per page. (Please also don't try to add multiple instances of the embed code to the page, as this won't work.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible to customize the widget to </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">split the tiles among multiple locations</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the page. This is not available by default, and would require development work. See the </span><strong>Advanced</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> section below for more information.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do I display the widget on multiple separate pages?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the widget leverages Site Engager rules to determine which tiles are displayed on which pages, you can simply create Site Engager rules as needed. Site Engager's rules also allow you to define which tiles the widget displays depending on the page where it is placed. For instructions on how to set up Site Engager rules, see </span><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022595791\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the article on Site Engager</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Uberflip knowledge base.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this a supported feature by Uberflip?</span></h2>\n<p><strong>No</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is an independent widget that makes use of supported elements of Uberflip, but its features and functionality are not tested and supported by Uberflip.</span></p>\n<h2>\n<strong>Advanced</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: How can my developers leverage this further?</span>\n</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good question :) There is an event and a couple functions that can be used to further leverage the data being returned and customize your website further. Developers can edit the embed code generated and insert additional functionality. Here’s an example:</span></p>\n<pre><code>/* Uberflip Reco Embed Viewer */<br>var ufRecoEmbedViewerConfig = {<br>.. <br>};<br><br>jQuery.when( jQuery.getScript(...) ).done(function(){<br><br>ufRecoEmbedViewer.init( ufRecoEmbedViewerConfig ); <br>//do stuff once data is available<br>ufRecoEmbedViewer.on('dataLoaded', function(){<br>var data = ufRecoEmbedViewer.getData();<br>console.log(\"we loaded the data!! here it is:\", data );<br>if(data.items.length ){<br>$('#custom-message').text('This Content is Just for You :)');<br><br>//load the first item after 5 seconds<br>setTimeout(function(){ ufRecoEmbedViewer.loadItem(0); },5000);<br>}<br>});<br>});\n</code></pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">So what’s happening here? Well, within the code block you can capture the data loading event</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ( </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ufRecoEmbedViewer.on('dataLoaded', function(){ … }); ~</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and “do stuff” like:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get the data ( </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ufRecoEmbedViewer.getData()</span> ~<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)  that’s returned by Site Engager - there’s tons of goodies in here including the items as well as the rules and template data.</span>\n</li>\n<li>Load an item whenever you like ( <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ufRecoEmbedViewer.loadItem(i) ~</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) where i is the index in the items array (i.e. 0 is the first item,etc)</span>\n</li>\n</ul>"

            "body": "<p>Add a little personalization magic to your Sales Streams with Flipbot's Magic Logo feature.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--danger\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Flipbot is being retired</h4>\n<p><strong>Flipbot will be going away on Nov. 1st, 2023.</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/14929481971341\" target=\"_self\">Flipbot is being retired [Nov. 2023]</a> for details. </p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-this-feature-do\">What does Magic Logo do?</h2>\n<p>The Magic Logo feature personalizes your Sales Streams with an automatically generated banner.</p>\n<p>This feature is essentially an automated version of the <em>Banner+Logo</em> template option that is available for Sales Streams (and Marketing Streams). By default, Sales Stream headers look like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://flipbot.uberflip.com/images/T0G1XZlVGrNsDXX6tF8_vlBK0YeS50kcfvxdKqtS7vXnFi9wXVzKJqgj__vr4EYlqZ3BUz1Sc_1p_fkhtjWU_ewNPNDxEAT96gnF4aJTVSyRaySYcwRLOx7_-1UZOePURW9OXNbg.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<p>But with Magic Logo (or the <em>Banner+Logo</em> template) turned on, they look like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://flipbot.uberflip.com/images/v_ijEsXn7IGqw6S2MdqESdzsz_2fcgL_ZFcRIj76pLhz6gZc1F8jH6-EGzsHTbKQR5tBhFWyemcrZ_fGNR_a4hnzApRALrG6fa4SEovOb-TUUppz3bXeq-sPr7AWNMSj64NhELPu.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<p>When enabled, Magic Logo adds a banner to the top of your Sales Stream with the following elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your company logo (derived from your Hub’s favicon) and the recipient’s company logo (from Clearbit), separated by a heart glyphicon</li>\n<li>A slightly faded background image (either specified by you, or a randomized city skyline)</li>\n<li>A transparent background color overlaid on the background image (customizable in Flipbot settings)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With Magic Logo, you don’t have to create a banner manually for every Sales Stream — just let Flipbot do it for you! This is especially useful when you create a Stream through the Uberflip Extension (where you can’t manually add a banner to your Stream).</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-enable-magic-logo\">How To Enable Magic Logo</h2>\n<p>To use Magic Logo, simply turn on the option <strong>Magic Logo Header</strong> in Flipbot’s settings, and configure the additional options according to your preference. See here [link to Configuration page &gt; Extra Feature Settings] for instructions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once Magic Logo is turned on, it will be active for all Sales Streams in the Hub(s) where Flipbot is installed! It’s not possible to turn it on/off for individual Sales Streams, but a workaround is available if Magic Logo isn’t returning the desired logo or you simply don’t want to use it on a particular Stream — see below for details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"how-magic-logo-works\">How Magic Logo Works</h2>\n<p>Flipbot uses the <a href=\"https://clearbit.com/logo\">free Logo API from Clearbit</a> to search for company logos. To know which company name to search for, Flipbot looks at the <strong>URL</strong> <strong>of the Sales Stream</strong>.</p>\n<p>A Stream’s URL is generated automatically from the Stream title, so a Stream with the title:</p>\n<p><em>A Stream for Microsoft</em></p>\n<p>Will generate this URL:</p>\n<p><em>…/a-stream-for-microsoft</em></p>\n<p>When Magic Logo is enabled, Flipbot searches for the string “-for-” in the URL, and assumes that the next word will be the company name, e.g. “<em>…/a-stream-for-</em><strong><em>microsoft</em></strong>\". If it finds a match, Flipbot searches Clearbit for this company name, and uses the top hit to create the banner:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://flipbot.uberflip.com/images/ojFN-F7QnZuQiHNG6q0D0ibrB3fPXGc3IoZ_RQcWXs9edTPpn1TY9D4gHTB3SIKIJ-rL8yrcGRF_0MyO3EbL2dB1KLCrBR3uJ3IQjDz5Zo9KOovRYoWBCX0Z060tGDUW5vcmIVOE.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<p>If there are any dashes in the company name in the URL, Flipbot assumes these are spaces when searching Clearbit. For example, if the URL is “<em>…/a-stream-for-schneider-electric</em>\", Flipbot will search for “schneider electric”:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://flipbot.uberflip.com/images/dLyFGDL9kUj8KFrW6TrWRbaY15kiQIxf8sNf-oLh99QfV-w6O6_AByKGGTYF6Jso04Q0W-FW6C0xwq9bitwKuh7zrcOXqPO--2VhWNEfqo8WY55Qq0uqjdp6pPLfeRD73kABw88i.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"using--troubleshooting-magic-logo\">Using &amp; Troubleshooting Magic Logo</h2>\n<p>For best results when using Magic Logo with Flipbot, you should name your Sales Streams using a format that Flipbot can understand: ideally, the resulting URL should end in “<em>…-for-[company]</em>\".</p>\n<p>If Flipbot can’t find “-for-” in the URL, it simply searches for the full URL slug. This works fine if the URL is only the company name, but will generally fail if it includes any other words.</p>\n<p>Note that Flipbot will search Clearbit for <em>any</em> word(s) found after “-for-” in the URL, and this can lead to unexpected/undesirable results. For example, if you use the Stream title “Hi Bob, here’s some content for you”, Flipbot will search Clearbit for the word “you”, which will return this result:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://flipbot.uberflip.com/images/zyPCsTg5Gm1Rh6pfUBwRkoB0DE5h2teGEYVfpngnMeqF6y_jxQWcXXh0Ss20eUU3QR8UTZfeqsFIktWNWTlF0OWTLr9g5fJMZbY1hNM39VUlVxFxPhwnAO2atZxo9v0qyggNInia.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<p>As a result, we strongly recommend following a consistent naming format with your Sales Streams if you choose to use Magic Logo.</p>\n<h3 id=\"test-magic-logo\">Test Magic Logo</h3>\n<p>You can check which logo the Magic Logo feature will use by sending a direct message to <strong>@flipbot</strong> in Slack. Use the command <em>/logocheck [company name]</em>, and insert the name of the company.</p>\n<p>If Flipbot can find a matching logo on Clearbit, it will show a preview:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://flipbot.uberflip.com/images/n2etUhcJpEwISssb76-U7YD_FI7PtlNEVNWQmH_-RrldDKl2GF5XxU3zDivw1D6L0lAaqJwhWSe5246d4tu6pWqGDD6dggQRb_Zjyja3q0lt70oCZTjilTBWUI454Q6AEy5r9FKl.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<p>If no match can be found, it will let you know:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://flipbot.uberflip.com/images/Iwr3mMTwsNioEVkYWYqfWKKpK8ACbNf_gKIPWqmhI6GYzOMdTo5vwlsKx_Hafj1WF_fk-E2GBlYmP2U0wh0_H5WCmFCxTuV340fneYnBME1y4h3OWroH4a0OxdnvCsFx9EVZVq3V.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This works as long as you have installed Flipbot in your Slack workspace, even if you have configured it not to send Slack notifications.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"workaround-to-disable-magic-logo\">Workaround to Disable Magic Logo</h3>\n<p>If Magic Logo is not returning the logo you want, or if you simply don’t want to use it on a particular Stream, simply change the Stream URL to something that won’t return a result when Flipbot searches for a logo. You can verify that no result will be returned by using the <em>/logocheck</em> command in Slack detailed above.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can change the Stream URL independently of the title, so there’s no need to change the title when you do this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"pager\"> </div>"

Most of this data is commonly collected (i.e. name, email, company, etc.), so your MAP has built-in <em>standard fields</em> to capture it in the lead profile.</p>\n<p>But in addition to these standard data points, Uberflip can also send useful <strong>Hub-specific data</strong> to your MAP, which can tell you about how your leads are interacting with your content. Your MAP doesn't contain the fields to capture this kind of data by default, so it needs to be recorded using <strong>custom fields </strong>that you can create when setting up the MAP integration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What kind of data is captured in Uberflip custom fields?</h2>\n<p>Uberflip custom fields capture information about how the lead interacted with content in your Hub, i.e. what kinds of content they viewed and how often, which content Item they converted on, etc. All Uberflip custom fields can be generally grouped into the following four categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Content Counter Fields</strong>: These fields capture an ongoing count of the number of times a lead viewed a particular type of content. Each content type has its own individual counter, e.g. <em>Flipbooks Viewed</em>, <em>Videos Viewed</em>, etc.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Lead Source Fields</strong>: These fields capture the specific CTA(s) a lead submitted — both the first CTA they ever submitted, and the one they submitted most recently.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>UF Last Visited Item Fields: </strong>These fields capture the Item a lead viewed most recently.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>UF Conversion Item Fields: </strong>These fields capture the content Item that a lead converted on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is a breakdown of all the custom fields Uberflip can create/use:</p>\n<table style=\"height: 435px;\" width=\"751\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 22px;\">\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 239px;

It always reflects the first Form CTA submitted by a lead, and is therefore never updated again once it has been set.</li>\n<li>The <em>Source </em>and <em>Source - Most Recent</em> fields will be updated together the first time a visitor submits a Form CTA, and will initially identify the same CTA.</li>\n<li>Whenever a lead (who has submitted at least one Form CTA) subsequently submits another Form CTA, the <em>Source - Most Recent</em> field is updated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>UF Last Visited Item Fields</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>uf_last_visited_item_title</em> and <em>uf_last_visited_item_id</em> fields are updated:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Any time a <strong>known</strong> visitor views an Item.</li>\n<li>When an <strong>unknown</strong> visitor submits a Form CTA for the first time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These fields are updated together, and will always match (i.e. will always identify the same Item).</li>\n<li>These fields will be updated only when a visitor views an Item page (i.e. a blog post, PDF, video, etc.). They will <strong>not</strong> be update on visits to Hub home pages or Stream pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note: Uberflip Item IDs</h4>\n<p>Every Item created in your Hub has a unique 9-digit ID. This ID is the same regardless of the Stream or Hub the Item is placed in. To find the ID of an Item, edit the Item in the Uberflip app, then look at the URL in your browser's address bar. The ID is the the 9-digit number located between two other strings of numbers:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360051742931/itemid.png\" alt=\"itemid.png\"></p>\n</div>\n<h3>UF Conversion Item Fields</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>uf_conversion_item_title</em> and <em>uf_conversion_item_id</em> fields are updated whenever a visitor submits a Form CTA that gates or is shown beside an Item.</li>\n<li>These fields are updated together, and will always match (i.e. will always identify the same Item).</li>\n<li>These fields will <strong>not</strong> be updated if a lead fills out a Form CTA in a Stream, or if a form is directly embedded into Uberflip from the MAP using an iFrame (rather than presented through a Form CTA).</li>\n<li>Additionally, the UF Conversion Item fields will also update <strong>without</strong> a Form CTA submission if the following conditions are met:\n<ul>\n<li>The visitor in question is <strong>known</strong> in your MAP (i.e. a lead who has previously filled out a Form CTA and whose browser has a cookie from your MAP)</li>\n<li>The visitor is <strong>fully profiled</strong> (has completed all available form fields on the Form CTA if Progressive Profiling is on)</li>\n<li>The visitor views an Item <strong>gated with a Form CTA</strong>\n</li>\n<li>The <em>Never hide this CTA</em> option is turned <strong>off</strong> on that Form CTA</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If all of the above conditions are met, the visitor will <strong>not be shown the Form CTA</strong>, but the UF Conversion Item fields will still be updated as though they had submitted a Form CTA.

            "body": "<hr>\n<p>Want to integrate your Hub with an external system that Uberflip doesn’t have a built-in integration for? To do that, you can create Custom Form CTAs.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HB6ZPRFEVYFYQ6CX6WTN8EWP\">Overview</h2>\n<p>Custom Form CTAs provide a method to push Uberflip CTA Data from Uberflip to an external service for further processing. They allow you to leverage Uberflip CTA functionality (Asset Gating, Show Besides, etc) without having to integrate a Marketing Automation Platform with Uberflip. This is useful in the following scenarios:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Your Marketing Automation Platform does not directly integrate with Uberflip</li>\n<li>You have a custom solution in place to ingest data</li>\n<li>You want to pass user data to a third party service for processing</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HB6ZPRFEB4BSNC5K8J9KSX7Z\">Limitations</h2>\n<p>One thing that is important to understand about Custom Form CTAs is that they come with their own list of caveats and limitations. You will need to consider the following before attempting to create a Custom Form CTA:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anything to do with Marketing Automation Platform cookies will not be leveraged by the CTA. If you wish to use MAP tracking cookies, they will need to be managed through the Custom Code area of Uberflip.</li>\n<li>CTAs will always display, regardless of if they've been submitted before. This could be remedied with a custom code solution (leveraging the onCtaSubmitSuccess Javascript event within Uberflip. More information on how to do that can be found <a href=\"https://learn.uberflip.com/developer-guides/adding-javascript-to-your-hub\">here</a>)</li>\n<li>Progressive Profiling is not available with Custom Form CTAs through Uberflip. This could be built as a custom Javascript solution, if desired.</li>\n<li>All data points will need to be assigned manually, including Uberflip conversion data. For example, uf_conversion_item_id would normally be pushed into a MAP field automatically. When using Custom Form CTAs, the JSON that is sent across will need to be leveraged and written to the contact record in the receiving system by the endpoint.</li>\n<li>Item tracking is not sent with the submit, only the last viewed stream. Any item tracking would need to be built as custom JS and appended to the CTA Submit manually (through hidden fields, for example)</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HB6ZPRFEYGXB69NYKYM6786N\">Create an Endpoint</h2>\n<p>The first thing you have to do when creating a custom CTA is define where the data from your CTA submit is going to be sent once the user submits their information. This process is the \"Custom\" in Custom Form CTA, and is entirely up to you and your internal resources.</p>\n<p>When Uberflip sends CTA data, it is sent as JSON. Here's an example of what data is passed across in an Uberflip Custom Form CTA submission:</p>\n<pre><small>{\n    \"event\": \"cta_submitted\",\n    \"occurred_at\": \"2016-05-31T11:24:33-04:00\",\n    \"account_id\": 8227,\n    \"cta_id\": 10194,\n    \"hub_id\": 4003,\n    \"submission\": {\n        \"url\": \"http:\/\/hub.dev.flyptech.com\/h\/i\/1232097-7-google-docs-hacks-for-more-efficient-content-creation\",\n        \"ip_address\": \"10.5.5.6\",\n        \"fields\": {\n            \"first_name\": \"John\",\n            \"last_name\": \"Doe\",\n            \"email_address\": \"john.doe@gmail.com\",\n            \"favourite_ice_cream\": \"dark_chocolate\",\n            \"opt_in_flag\": \"1\"\n        },\n\n        \"item_id\": 1232097,\n        \"stream_id\": 38898,\n        \"previous_item_id\": 1232094,\n        \"previous_stream_id\": 38898\n    }\n}</small></pre>\n<p>In order to do anything with that information, we'll need something to receive and process that output. Once that piece has been built, we can then integrate that with Uberflip.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HB6ZPRFE7WM6TS43ZZ9T2K6W\">Set Up Custom Integration with Uberflip</h2>\n<p>In order to integrate your brand new endpoint, do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Account Settings &gt; Integration &gt; Custom Integration<br><img style=\"width: 256px; height: 154px;\" src=\"https://content.cdntwrk.com/files/aHViPTQyNjMxJmNtZD1pdGVtZWRpdG9yaW1hZ2UmZmlsZW5hbWU9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlXzVhZjlhZjMyMzZiYmYucG5nJnZlcnNpb249MDAwMCZzaWc9MTE1NTAzMjgzNjc5NTRhYTEyZTk5OWNiM2U1Yzc2N2U%253D\" alt=\"Custom Integrations Menu\">\n</li>\n<li>Click \"Add Custom Integration\"<br><img style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://content.cdntwrk.com/files/aHViPTQyNjMxJmNtZD1pdGVtZWRpdG9yaW1hZ2UmZmlsZW5hbWU9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlXzVhZjlhZjcyNDMwYzUucG5nJnZlcnNpb249MDAwMCZzaWc9ZTFjNzQzNDFkYWQyYzVhY2YyYjc0YzQ5NDFkY2I2MjM%253D\" alt=\"\">\n</li>\n<li>This screen has a few parameters; see below for instructions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HB6ZPRFEEWW59JPG7MACD5QR\">Custom Integration Parameters</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB6ZPRFEYJRDBFT953VRN2V1\">Required and Recommended</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Name (Required)</strong>: The Name of your Custom Integration</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Description:</strong> A short description of your integration (i.e. what it does, what its for etc)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>On Submit (Required)</strong> - The action taken when a user submits your CTA.

You can find it under <em>Dashboards &gt; Visitor Insights</em> in your Hub menu.</p>\n<p>Bombora collects data about your visitors across both your Hub and other websites, which is then presented in an easily digested dashboard format on your Hub. The dashboard displays a combination of intent, demographic, and firmographic data:</p>\n<dl class=\"dl-horizontal\">\n<dt>Intent Data</dt>\n<dd>Data Bombora has collected about a web user's online behavior. When a user searches for a particular topic, or consumes content related to it, it indicates an interest in that topic. Factoring in the user's context (i.e data about the user themselves, i.e. their demographic and firmographic data) makes it possible to predict their <em>intent </em>to take action in relation to the topic, i.e. buying a product.</dd>\n<dt>Demographic Data</dt>\n<dd>Data relating to a who a user is. In this context, the term specifically refers to segmenting users based on their department and job function.</dd>\n<dt>Firmographic Data</dt>\n<dd>Data about a web user's organization, such as company size, revenue, and industry.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This data is tailored to your Hub, so it can help you to gain a better understanding of who your visitors are, and what they're interested in. This puts you in a better position to create content experiences that speak to your visitors and increase their engagement with your business.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Using the Visitor Insights Dashboard: The Basics</h2>\n<p>The Visitor Insights dashboard consists of two major sections, the <strong>radar chart</strong> and the <strong>insights:</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019778832\" alt=\"Hubs___Visitor_Insights_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"523\" height=\"740\"></p>\n<p>All of the data shown on the dashboard, in both the radar chart and the insights, is controlled by the <strong>date range filters</strong> shown across the top of the dashboard:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019778912\" alt=\"Hubs___Visitor_Insights_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>As the most recent data is the most relevant in this context, these filters represent a rolling date range relative to the current date. By default, the data displayed will be fore the current calendar month (<em>this month</em>), but you can also expand the range to the previous month, the previous three months, or the previous 6 months, by clicking on the corresponding options.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>Note that <em>month</em> in each of these options refers to calendar months. For example, if today is December 18th:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>This Month:</strong> Dec. 1 - Dec. 17</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last Month:</strong> Nov. 1 - Nov. 30</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Previous 3 Months:</strong> Sept. 1 - Nov 30</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Previous 6 Months:</strong> June 1 - Nov. 30</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Reading the Radar Chart</h2>\n<h3>Intent Topics</h3>\n<p>The radar chart consists of radiating spokes, each of which is labeled with an <strong>intent topic</strong>. Bombora automatically generates the radar chart using the intent topics it has identified as being most relevant to your Hub:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019779292\" alt=\"Hubs___Visitor_Insights_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>Keep in mind that \"relevant\" does not necessarily mean that these topics are supposed to represent the major focus areas of your Hub! The chart reflects both topics that your Hub has content about <em>and</em> topics that attracted visitors to your Hub. This means that topics might appear here that are outside your usual scope, and for which you don't currently have any content. However, as visitors came to your Hub because of an interest in these topics, they can suggest opportunities for content development.</p>\n<h3>Topic Metrics</h3>\n<p>The colored polygons radiating from the hub of the intent topic spokes represent different metrics related to the intent topics:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019652031\" alt=\"Hubs___Visitor_Insights_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>The metrics represented on the chart are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Items Receiving Traffic (Blue): </strong>Identifies topics which are driving traffic to your content. The further the polygon extends along a spoke, the more traffic content related to that topic generated.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019780972\" alt=\"Hubs___Visitor_Insights_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"305\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Newly Created Items (Yellow): </strong>Identifies topics for which you have created applicable content within the selected timeframe. The further the polygon extends along a spoke, the more content was created related to that topic.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019652371\" alt=\"Hubs___Visitor_Insights_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"499\" height=\"302\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Visitors (Pink): </strong>Identifies topics your visitors are most interested in, independent of your Hub content. The further the polygon extends along a spoke, the more interest visitors have expressed in that topic based on their web behavior in general.\n<h3><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019652431\" alt=\"Hubs___Visitor_Insights_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"307\"></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can display or hide any metric on the chart by clicking on its checkbox in the filters shown below the chart:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019653271\" alt=\"Hubs___Visitor_Insights_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>In addition, hovering your mouse over a metric's polygon at a spot where it does not overlap with another polygon will highlight it, making it easier to see:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019653451\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-01-29__6_09_PM.png\" width=\"286\" height=\"235\"></p>\n<h3>Interpreting the Chart</h3>\n<p>By default, the three polygons are overlaid on top of one another. This allows you to compare them, and provides insights into how well your content is aligned with your audience's interests.</p>\n<p>For example, take a look at the <em>Account-Based Marketing (ABM)</em> spoke for a given month in our example chart from <a href=\"https://hub.uberflip.com/\">Uberflip's Resource Hub</a>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019654351\" alt=\"Hubs___Visitor_Insights_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>We can see that the blue polygon and the yellow polygon both extend about the same distance along the spoke, but the pink polygon goes much further. First, let's analyze what each of these means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blue represents topics that are receiving a lot of traffic, so we can see that we're generating a moderate amount of traffic to content about ABM</li>\n<li>Yellow represents newly created content for a topic, so we can see that, compared to other topics, we created a relatively small amount of new content about ABM in the month shown</li>\n<li>Pink represents topics that visitors are interested in, so we can see that the Hub is attracting a lot of visitors who are interested in ABM</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So what conclusions can we draw from this? Clearly, visitors to our Hub were very interested in ABM. However, we didn't drive as much traffic to our relevant content as we might have expected, so we may not have promoted it sufficiently. We also didn't create much new content about ABM during this period, so this was likely a factor that affected discoverability. Based on these insights, our marketing team can now work to improve the promotion and targeting of our existing content about ABM, or work to create new content to meet this obvious audience interest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Understanding the Insights</h2>\n<p>Below the radar chart, you'll find a series of six tables:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019654771\" alt=\"Hubs___Visitor_Insights_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>These tables display the top five intent topics and demographic and firmographic segments for visitors during the selected timeframe. The categories represented on these tables are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Top Visitor Topics</strong>: The intent topics that visitors were most interested in</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Top Functional Areas</strong>: The most-represented business areas among visitors</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Top Professional Groups</strong>: If identifiable, the most-represented professional groupings of visitors</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Top Company Size</strong>: The most-represented organizational size segments among visitors</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Top Company Revenue</strong>: The most-represented revenue segments among visitors</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Top Industries</strong>: The most-represented industry segments among visitors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each of the top five items in each category, you can see its percentage share of the overall total. You can also compare these percentages as a bar chart by simply hovering your mouse over the table:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360019690611\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-01-30__10_31_AM.png\"></p>\n<p>These insights are helpful for analyzing whether your audience corresponds to the market segments you are targeting with your content strategy. Since these metrics represent actual visitors to your Hub, they can also sometimes offer suggestions as to segments that you're not actively targeting, but which may be worth your attention based on organic interest.</p>"

            "body": "<hr>\n<p>Follow these guidelines to ensure that thumbnails are displayed on Item tiles for Blog Streams imported via RSS.</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>The guidelines in this article apply to Item tiles in Hubs using default Uberflip technology. If you're using custom code that affects Item tiles, this may alter the experience in your Hub.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>About Blog Stream Thumbnails</h2>\n<p>When you create a Blog Stream that imports posts from an external blog, Uberflip will try to automatically add a thumbnail image to each Item in the Stream. Your Streams will look a lot more attractive with thumbnails, so you should always try to ensure that a suitable thumbnail can be assigned to each Item by following the guidelines in this article.</p>\n<p>Here's how it works: to find a suitable image, Uberflip checks in three locations in a particular order. The locations and the order they are checked is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Image tags in the RSS feed</li>\n<li>Media tags in the RSS feed</li>\n<li>Facebook Open Graph tags in source page HTML</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If no suitable image is found in one location, Uberflip moves onto the next location. Uberflip looks for just the <em>first</em> match in each location (e.g. the first image tag, the first media tag, etc.) and then checks if it meets the minimum requirements (see below). If the requirements aren't met, then Uberflip does not check for additional matches in the same location (e.g. any other image tags), but instead moves on to the next location.</p>\n<p>To make sure that your preferred image is used as an Item's thumbnail, it should:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Appear in the RSS version of the blog post wrapped in image tags</li>\n<li>Be the <strong>first</strong> image</li>\n<li>Meet the requirements to be selected, as well as the size requirements (see below)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find more details on the size requirements for images, and how Uberflip looks for images in each location, below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_640872973231544638679801\">General Thumbnail Image Size Requirements</h2>\n<p>Regardless of the location a thumbnail image is found in, it must meet minimum width and length requirements to be used. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Minimum width:</strong> 180 pixels</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Minimum height:</strong> 100 pixels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By default, images below the minimum size on one or both of these dimensions will not be used as thumbnails.</p>\n<p>If you want, you can override the minimum image size requirement for thumbnails. You can do this when you initially create the Blog Stream by checking the box next to <strong>Allow small images to be used for thumbnails</strong>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360017252131/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"358\" height=\"373\"></p>\n<p>You can also override the requirement on already created Blog Streams by opening the Stream and going to the <strong>Options tab</strong>. Here, turn the setting for <strong>Prevent using small images as thumbnails</strong> to the <strong>off (grey) </strong>position:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360017252471/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"693\" height=\"88\"></p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Caution</h4>\n<p>We don't recommend using these overrides, as the minimum image size requirement is in place to ensure that your Blog Stream Item thumbnails look acceptable on most displays. In general, images smaller than the minimum size requirement will look pixelated and unclear. You can find more information about our recommended image sizes in <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020030752\">this article</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>HTML Image Tags</h2>\n<p>The first place our system will always look for thumbnail images is in the RSS feed itself. Specifically, it will look for HTML <em>&lt;img&gt;</em> tags in the RSS version of each article. These tags must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define the <strong>width </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>height</strong> of the image in pixels, and</li>\n<li>Those dimensions must meet the <a href=\"#h_640872973231544638679801\">minimum size requirements</a> (W:180px x H:100px)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Images that do not have dimensions specified in the tag, or where either width or height are under the minimum, will be ignored by the system. For example:</p>\n<p><strong>Image that will be used as a thumbnail<br></strong></p>\n<pre> &lt;img src=\"http://www.mycompany.com/blog/image.png\" width=\"300px\" height=\"296px\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p><strong>Images that will not be used as a thumbnail<br></strong></p>\n<pre> &lt;img src=\"http://www.mycompany.com/blog/image.png\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p><em>Image dimensions not specified</em></p>\n<pre>&lt;img src=\"http://www.mycompany.com/blog/image.png\" width=\"50px\" height=\"100px\" /&gt; </pre>\n<p><em>Width is below minimum</em></p>\n<p>If there are multiple valid <em>&lt;img&gt;</em> tags in the article, only the first-appearing image will be evaluated and (if it meets the requirements) selected.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note: WordPress Featured Images</h4>\n<p>If the blog you are importing is hosted on <strong>WordPress</strong>, and you use <strong>Featured Images</strong> on that blog, note that WordPress does <strong>not</strong> include Featured Images in the RSS Feed. As a result, these images won't be pulled in to your Hub via RSS by default.</p>\n<p>In WordPress, you can include Featured Images in the RSS feed by using a plugin. While we can't recommend any particular plugin, you can use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/featured+image+rss/\">this sample search</a> as a starting point. In general, any plugin that includes Features Images in your RSS feed should work for bringing those images into your Uberflip Hub.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>RSS Media Tags</h2>\n<p>If our system is unable to find a valid thumbnail image within the <em>&lt;img&gt;</em> tags in the RSS version of an article, it will look in the <em>&lt;media:content&gt;</em> tags next. This is an RSS tag that is used to specify the attributes of media objects in RSS items (see <a href=\"http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss#media-content\">this page</a> for more information).</p>\n<p>RSS <em>&lt;media:content&gt;</em> tags have numerous attributes, most of which are optional. In order for Uberflip to select a thumbnail image from a <em>&lt;media:content&gt;</em> tag, the following attributes must be set:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>url</li>\n<li>medium (value must be <em>image</em>)</li>\n<li>width (minimum value <em>180</em>)</li>\n<li>height (minimum value <em>100</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there are multiple valid <em>&lt;media:content&gt;</em> tags in the article, only the first-appearing image will be evaluated and (if it meets the requirements) selected.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Open Graph Tags</h2>\n<p>If our system can't find a thumbnail in the <em>&lt;img&gt;</em> tags or <em>&lt;media:content&gt;</em> tags in the RSS version of the article, it will look for Facebook <a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/facebook-meta-tags\">Open Graph Meta Tags</a> as a fallback.</p>\n<p>To do this, we go to the source URL for the article and parse the page's full HTML for instances of Open Graph image tags, which look like this:</p>\n<pre>&lt;meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"image source url\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre>&lt;link rel=\"image_src\" href=\"image source url\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>If an image is found in these tags, and it meets the minimum size requirements, then it will be used as the Item's thumbnail. This is intended as a last resort only: for best results, you should try to make sure that one of the other two locations (ideally the image tags) contain a suitable image to be used as a thumbnail.</p>"

It explains how the subdirectory option works, and the instructions below will assume you are familiar with the concepts it covers.</li>\n<li>To follow these instructions, you need to be an <strong>Account Administrator</strong> (and ideally the <strong>Primary User</strong>) on your account.</li>\n<li>Some of the steps will require knowledge of your current website hosting setup as well as the ability to make changes to it. For these parts, you will most likely need to get help from your organization's web administrator.</li>\n<li>All the instructions in this article refer to a single Hub. If you have <strong>multiple Hubs</strong> that you want to set up on subdirectory custom domains, the instructions will be exactly the same — you just have to repeat the steps for each separate Hub (as needed).</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What You'll Need</h2>\n<p>To host your Hub on a custom domain that is a subdirectory of your website, you will need <strong>reverse proxy capability</strong> on that website. The reverse proxy can be implemented in any form you choose (see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018964792\">this article</a> for more information about the various options), as long as it supports the functionality outlined in <a href=\"#h_404965782281542147304648\">the checklist below</a>. Ask your web admin to review the checklist to confirm that your current setup will work.</p>\n<p>Note that the reverse proxy must <em>already be in place</em> before you proceed. This article will not cover how to add a reverse proxy to your website.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_404965782281542147304648\">Reverse Proxy Functionality Checklist</h3>\n<p>No matter what kind of reverse proxy you intend to use, it must be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Proxy requests under a given subdirectory to a specific origin server.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This means you must be able to set up a rule on the reverse proxy to take requests for\n<pre><em>http://</em><em>www.mycompany.com/resources/*</em></pre>\nand direct them to a server you specify (i.e. Uberflip's server). Note that the rule must also be applicable to requests for directories <em>under</em> the main subdirectory specified, such as\n<pre><em>http://</em><em>www.mycompany.com/resources<strong>/blog/posts</strong></em></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Proxy requests with the following HTTP methods: <em>GET, POST, HEAD</em>, and <em>OPTIONS</em>.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This just means that <em>at minimum </em>these types of requests must be passed through to the origin server — you <em>do not</em> have to block other request types.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Pass through requests to the origin server <em>unmodified</em> and <em>in their entirety</em>.</strong></li>\n<ul>\n<li>This means that the requests must come through with the full requested URL and all headers (user agent string, cookies, etc.) intact — the reverse proxy must not strip anything out or otherwise change the request in any way. This is important for accurate Hub metrics.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Disable caching of the origin server.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This is mainly specific to CDNs, as their default behavior is usually to cache (make a copy) of the origin server and serve up the copy instead. If it does this, metrics for the Hub will be inaccurate, so make sure caching is turned off.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your reverse proxy meets all these requirements, you're ready to set up your Hub on a subdirectory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 1: Contact Us</h2>\n<p>To get started, reach out to your Uberflip Customer Success Manager and let them know that you're interested in setting up a custom domain on a subdirectory. They'll be able to provide guidance throughout the process, and will facilitate the parts of the setup process that need to happen on Uberflip's end.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 2: Choose and Create the Subdirectory</h2>\n<p>You'll need to begin by deciding what you want the subdirectory to be. This is where your visitors will go to access your Hub, so it's time to get creative! We recommend choosing something that describes what your visitors can expect to find in your Hub. Here are some examples to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>www.mycompany.com/<strong>resources</strong>\n</li>\n<li>www.mycompany.com/<strong>insights</strong>\n</li>\n<li>www.mycompany.com/<strong>learn</strong>\n</li>\n<li>www.mycompany.com/<strong>community</strong>\n</li>\n<li>www.mycompany.com/<strong>hub</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The subdirectory can be at any level in the directory structure. For example, if you want your Hub to be accessible under the subdirectory <em>hub</em>, but you want that to live under</p>\n<pre><em>www.mycompany.com/resources/insights/<strong>hub</strong>/</em></pre>\n<p>this is also possible.</p>\n<p>Once you've decided on the subdirectory you want, you have to create it on your website. Your website admin should be able to do this for you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 3: Hand off to Uberflip to Create and Link the Custom Domain</h2>\n<p>At this point we'll need to do some setup work on our end, so your next step is to get back in touch with your Uberflip CSM.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Let your CSM know that you've created the subdirectory on your website where your Hub will live.</li>\n<li>Provide the URL for the subdirectory, i.e. the URL you want to use for your Hub. For example:\n<ul>\n<li>Hub URL (Subdirectory): <em>www.mycompany.com/resources</em>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Indicate whether your website uses SSL (HTTPS).\n<ul>\n<li>If your website <em>does</em> use SSL, you do <strong>not</strong> have to provide us with a certificate. The certificate that applies to your main website will also cover the subdomain where your Hub will live.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your Customer Success Manager or Implementation Specialist will link the custom domain you chose to your Hub as a <strong>secondary</strong> domain. This means that your Hub will remain accessible under its current domain, but will <em>also</em> become accessible under the new custom domain for testing (it will be set to not be indexed by search engines) once your reverse proxy is set up.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 4: Configure Your Reverse Proxy</h2>\n<p>When everything is ready to go on Uberflip's end, your CSM will let you know that you can now configure your reverse proxy. This will set it up so that requests for your Hub's new custom domain are sent to Uberflip's origin server, which will return your Hub.</p>\n<p>As it requires access to your website's hosting infrastructure, this step generally has to be performed by your web administrator. We've created a separate guide to help them do that, which you can find here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019729931\">Configure Your Reverse Proxy for an Uberflip Hub</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just provide the guide to your web admin and ask them to perform the setup for you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 5: Test the Reverse Proxy Setup</h2>\n<p>When your web admin has finished setting up the reverse proxy, let your CSM know so they can help you test it. You can also do some initial testing at this stage: simply go to the Hub URL in your browser, and the Hub <em>should</em> come up. Navigate around the Hub a little to see if it's all working as expected.</p>\n<p>Once your CSM gives you the all-clear that the reverse proxy is configured properly, you just have to decide when you want to switch over.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 6: Switch Over to the New Custom Domain</h2>\n<p>Your CSM will work with you to decide on a date for the switch to the new custom domain. Once you have settled on a date and a cutover plan, here's what will happen next:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your CSM will remove your new (subdirectory) custom domain from your Hub as a secondary domain.</li>\n<li>They will then move your Hub off your old custom domain (if you were using one), and make the new custom domain (subdirectory) the primary domain. This will instantly make the new custom domain the active domain for your Hub.</li>\n<li>At the same time, they will set up a redirect on your Hub's previous domain so that any requests for it are automatically redirected to the new domain. They will also ensure any canonical URLs we have stored are updated to the new domain as well.</li>\n<li>When they've completed the cutover, your CSM will notify you that your Hub is ready on the new custom domain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this point, you can verify that it's working properly: just go to your new custom domain's URL in your browser, and your Hub should load up (as it did before, during testing). Navigate around a little and make sure everything is working as expected.</p>\n<p>Does everything look good? If it does, congratulations — you've successfully set up your Hub on a subdirectory custom domain!</p>\n<p>If anything isn't working correctly, let your CSM know right away so they can start troubleshooting (and temporarily revert your Hub back to the old custom domain, if necessary).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Next Steps: SEO Settings</h2>\n<p>Once you have your Hub up and running on your subdirectory custom domain, the next thing you should do is make sure you have <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028437152\" target=\"_self\">set up your SEO settings</a> correctly. Even if you have already done this previously, there are some differences that are specific to subdirectory custom domains that you'll need to account for.</p>\n<p>The reason for this is that key SEO mechanisms (like sitemaps and <em>robots.txt</em>) generally apply to the entire domain, so search engines like Google look for them in the <em>root</em> (or lowest/main) <em>directory</em> of the domain. On a subdomain custom domain (e.g. <em>https://resources.mycompany.com/</em>), Uberflip has access to the root directory, and can place and modify sitemaps and <em>robots</em><em>.txt</em> here.</p>\n<p>However, on a <strong>subdirectory</strong> custom domain (e.g. <em>https://www.mycompany.com/resources</em>), the root directory is part of your website's domain — and Uberflip does not have access to it. This means that while Uberflip will still generate sitemaps and <em>robots.txt</em> for your Hub, they will be placed in the subdirectory. Google will not look for them there, so unless you take some action, they will have no effect.</p>\n<p>Here's what you will need to do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Sitemaps: </strong>Get your Hub's sitemap index file and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451001\">submit it to Google Search Console</a>. You can get your sitemap index file by adding <code class=\"no-padding\">sitemap_index.xml</code> to the end of your Hub's homepage URL, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">https://www.mycompany.com/resources/sitemap_index.xml</code>. You'll only need to do this once — Google will automatically follow any changes to a previously submitted sitemap.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Robots.txt:</strong> Uberflip uses <em>robots.txt</em> to block search engines from indexing your entire Hub (i.e. when the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018840252#block-indexing-at-the-hub-level\" target=\"_self\">Hub-level No Robots Meta Tag setting</a> is turned on). If you want to do this, you will need to manually add a rule to your main website's <em>robots.txt </em>to prevent indexing of the subdirectory containing your Hub (and anything within it). If you want your Hub to be generally indexable and only specific Streams to be blocked, you can simply use the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018840252#block-indexing-at-the-stream-level\">Stream-level No Robots Meta Tag setting</a>, and do <strong>not</strong> need to make any changes to <em>robots.txt</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you need some guidance on how to complete these steps, please <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\">contact Uberflip Support</a>.</p>"
