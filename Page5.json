This feature is included with certain pack types, or may be added on to your Uberflip subscription. For more information, please speak with your Uberflip account representative.</li>\n<li>To follow the instructions in this article, you must be a member of the <strong>Account Administrators</strong> user group in the Uberflip account where you are using Code Saver.\n<ul>\n<li>After installing the Code Saver Marketplace app, you can also add the <em><strong>Code Saver &gt; View Code Saver App </strong></em>permission to any user or user group to allow them to access Code Saver.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About Code Saver</h2>\n<p>Code Saver is a utility for <strong>backing up and restoring <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_self\">Custom Code</a></strong> in your Uberflip Hubs. With Code Saver, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Automatically back up the code in Custom Code blocks</strong> from your Hubs to a secure GitHub repository every 24 hours</li>\n<li>Browse all individual Code Block backups, view the code that was backed up, and <strong>restore any backup of your choice</strong> to your Hub with just a few clicks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Code Saver is designed to help you recover from situations where you have accidentally broken your Hub's Custom Code, such as if you unintentionally delete a Custom Code block, or make changes that render the code non-functional. If this happens, you can use Code Saver to restore an earlier, working version of the affected Custom Code block to bring your Hub back to full functionality.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Install Code Saver</h2>\n<p>To use Code Saver, you must first install the <strong>Code Saver Marketplace app</strong>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Log in</strong> to your Uberflip account at <strong><a href=\"https://app.uberflip.com\" target=\"_self\">app.uberflip.com</a>.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Go to the <a href=\"https://marketplace.uberflip.com/details/code-saver/\" target=\"_self\">Code Saver listing page in Uberflip Marketplace</a>.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Install</strong>.</li>\n<li>If the app has been successfully installed, you'll see <strong>Code Saver </strong>listed under <strong>Marketplace &gt; Installed Apps</strong> in Uberflip:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360095448872/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>In addition, you'll also see a new <strong>Code Saver</strong> menu option in the sidebar menu in Uberflip:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360095371151/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Open Code Saver</h2>\n<p>To set up Code Saver to back up your Custom Code, and to restore it, open up the app from within Uberflip.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Log in</strong> to your Uberflip account at <strong><a href=\"https://app.uberflip.com\" target=\"_self\">app.uberflip.com</a>.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Code Saver</strong> in the sidebar menu:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360095371151/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>You will be logged in to Code Saver automatically, and the Code Saver app interface will appear on the right.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>Code Saver accesses your account using your Uberflip API credentials.

When you restore a backup of a Custom Code block that has been deleted, Code Saver will <strong>recreate</strong> the Custom Code block in Uberflip, then restore the code within it. Code Saver will then also resume backing up the recreated Custom Code block (provided backups are enabled for the Hub).</li>\n</ul>"

For example, say you use the query string parameter <strong>?campaign= </strong>to track your campaigns. Here's how it would work:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, create a new hidden field on a Form CTA.</li>\n<li>Next, specify the field in your MAP where you want to record the query string data. This will depend on the specific query string parameter you're capturing: in this case, the appropriate MAP field might be something like <em>Campaign Source</em> (or similar).</li>\n<li>Then, configure the hidden field to look for the query string parameter <strong>?campaign=</strong>. This sets up the hidden field to capture the value of that query string parameter if it is present in the visitor's URL when they enter your Hub.</li>\n<li>Finally, add the hidden field to the Form CTA.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, anytime a visitor enters your hub using a link with the query string parameter ?<strong>campaign= </strong>and submits a Form CTA, Uberflip will capture the value of that query string parameter (i.e. the campaign name) and store it in the <em>Campaign Name</em> field in that visitor's lead profile in your MAP.</p>\n<p>A few things to note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>This works even if the visitor moves between different pages in your Hub</strong> <strong>before submitting a Form CTA</strong>: When a visitor uses a URL with query strings to enter your Hub, Uberflip saves the query string parameters and values in the cache. That way they can still be captured by Form CTAs, even if the visitor moves between pages (which strips away the query strings from the URL).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You need to set up individual hidden fields for each separate query string parameter</strong>: Because you have to specify the individual MAP field where query string data is recorded, you need to create a different hidden field for each query string parameter you want to capture.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Form CTA will only capture query string data if it contains the appropriate hidden field</strong>: If a visitor enters your Hub with a query string, but only submits a Form CTA to which you have <strong>not</strong> added a hidden field for that query string parameter, the query string data will not be recorded. You have to separately add hidden fields to each Form CTA on which you want to use them (or clone a CTA on which you set up the hidden fields and modify it).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you're ready to get started, see below for instructions on how to set this up.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_537249306111547659144354\">Prerequisite: Identify query string data and MAP field names</h2>\n<p>Before you can begin creating hidden fields to capture query string data, there are a few things you need to do:</p>\n<p><strong>First,</strong> <strong>determine</strong> <strong>which query string parameters you want to capture</strong>. Note that you need to specify the exact field(s) in your MAP where this data will be recorded, so you'll need to decide what kind of information you'll be capturing in order to choose the correct fields in your MAP.</p>\n<p><strong>Next, identify the field (or fields) in your MAP where the query string data will be captured. </strong>Your MAP contains a variety of data fields, and each is intended to store a specific type of data. Based on the query string data you've chosen, you will need to determine the appropriate field(s) in your MAP to store it. This will depend on your MAP, and how your organization uses it. If you're not sure which field to use, check with the administrator of your MAP.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>Remember: in general, you'll need to use a separate MAP field for each individual query string parameter you want to capture.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Finally, find the unique field name for each field you've identified. </strong>Every field in your MAP has a special \"name\" that uniquely identifies it. When you set up your Form CTA in Uberflip, you will need to use this unique field name to tell Uberflip where to send data captured from the query string.</p>\n<p>See below for instructions on where to find these unique field names in your MAP:</p>\n<div class=\"tabs\">\n<div class=\"tabs-menu\">\n<span class=\"tabs-link is-active\">HubSpot</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Marketo</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Oracle Eloqua</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Pardot</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab\">\n<p>In HubSpot, you're looking for the <strong>internal name </strong>of a property.

In HTML, <em>tags</em> are simply labels that indicate what each element on a webpage is. For example, the <code class=\"no-padding\">&lt;title&gt;</code> tag signifies that the text it contains is the title of a page, the <code class=\"no-padding\">&lt;img&gt;</code> tag indicates an image, and so on.</p>\n<p>Some HTML tags are <em>meta</em> tags that contain <strong>metadata</strong>, or \"data about data\". Metadata provides information about the contents of a webpage, such as the title, content type, description, etc. <strong>Open Graph tags</strong> and <strong>Twitter Card tags</strong> fall into this category: they contain information about the page they're on, and are intended to tell other websites and web services what the page is about.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What do these tags do?</h2>\n<p>When you share a link on social platforms like Facebook or Twitter, or on messaging apps like Slack, you've probably noticed that a little preview of the destination page automatically appears. For example, when this URL is shared on Twitter...</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hub.uberflip.com/blog/how-technology-and-software-marketers-use-uberflip\">https://hub.uberflip.com/blog/how-technology-and-software-marketers-use-uberflip</a></p>\n<p>...it turns into this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360054702432/og1.png\" alt=\"og1.png\"></p>\n<p>How do social platforms know what to display in these previews? They simply visit the link and look at its Open Graph tags or Twitter Card tags. Both types of tags are specifically designed to tell web platforms and services what they should display when a link to the page is shared.</p>\n<p>The benefit of using these tags is pretty clear: where a plain URL link offers almost no information about the content it points to, a preview provides the title and a brief description to tell people why clicking the link is worth their time. And when an image is included, a preview is also far more eye-catching than just a text-only link.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How does my Hub use these tags?</h2>\n<p>Uberflip automatically creates Open Graph and Twitter Card tags in the <code class=\"no-padding\">&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the HTML on all Item pages, Stream pages, and Hub home pages of your Uberflip Hubs. The values of these tags are automatically populated using metadata from the corresponding Hub, Stream, or Item.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">What's the difference between Open Graph tags and Twitter Card tags?</h4>\n<p>You might be wondering why there are two types of tags that seem to do the exact same thing. The reason is simple: Facebook and Twitter each decided to design their own protocols, and both are widely used. In practice, some web services support one protocol or the other, and many support both. Facebook's <a href=\"https://ogp.me/\">Open Graph protocol</a> is generally used by more services (such as LinkedIn, Pinterest, and even Twitter); Twitter's <a href=\"https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/abouts-cards\">Twitter Card protocol</a> was originally intended primarily for use on Twitter, but is also supported by some services such as Slack.</p>\n<p>When it comes to your Uberflip Hubs, the bottom line is that you don't need to worry about the difference. To make sure all your bases are covered, your Hubs generate both types of tag, with the same information in each set of tags.</p>\n</div>\n<p>To see the tags for your own Hubs, simply visit any page in a Hub, right-click anywhere, then click on <strong>View Page Source</strong>. When the source code appears, do a search for \"og:\" or \"twitter:\" to see the tags. For example, here they are for the example post shown above:</p>\n<p><em>Open Graph tags</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360054702452/og2.png\" alt=\"og2.png\"></p>\n<p><em>Twitter Card tags</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360054821971/og3.png\" alt=\"og3.png\"></p>\n<h3>Open Graph tags</h3>\n<p>Open Graph tags are all in the format of <code class=\"no-padding\">og:tagname</code>.

Uberflip creates the following Twitter Card tags for Hub home pages, Stream pages, and Item pages:</p>\n<table style=\"height: 432px;\" width=\"632\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 199.333px;\"><strong>Tag</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 199.333px;\"><strong>Description</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 199.333px;\"><code class=\"no-padding\">twitter:card</code></td>\n<td style=\"width: 199.333px;\">The <a href=\"https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/summary\">type of Twitter card</a> that should be displayed using the tags</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 199.333px;\"><code class=\"no-padding\">twitter:image</code></td>\n<td style=\"width: 199.333px;\">A thumbnail image that will be shown with the content when shared</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 199.333px;\"><code class=\"no-padding\">twitter:title</code></td>\n<td style=\"width: 199.333px;\">The title of the content, e.g. \"A Blog Post\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 199.333px;\"><code class=\"no-padding\">twitter:description</code></td>\n<td style=\"width: 199.333px;\">A brief description of the content </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 199.333px;\"><code class=\"no-padding\">twitter:site</code></td>\n<td style=\"width: 199.333px;\">The Twitter account associated with the content</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>When creating previews from Twitter Card tags, Twitter respects any indexing rules (i.e. robots meta tag/<em>robots</em><em>.txt</em>) present for that website. If you have set your Hub to <strong>not</strong> be indexed by <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018840252\" target=\"_self\">turning on the <strong>No Robots Meta Tag</strong> setting</a>, Twitter will interpret this to mean that it should not display any content from that Hub, including images. As a result, sharing content from a Hub set to <em>noindex </em>will cause the resulting Twitter card previews to be shown <strong>without</strong> images. </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Can I change these tags?</h2>\n<p>The Open Graph tags and Twitter Card can't be modified <em>directly</em>: their values are automatically set using data taken from the relevant Hub, Stream, or Item. For example, the <code class=\"no-padding\">og:title</code>/<code class=\"no-padding\">twitter:title</code> tags for an Item page are set using the Item title you specified in the Uberflip app.</p>\n<p>This means you can <em>indirectly</em> set the values of some tags by changing the fields that they are tied to in the Uberflip app (see below for details). These tags are always linked to their respective app fields and can't be set independently, so you can't have an Open Graph/Twitter Card title that's different from the Item title in your Hub, for example.</p>\n<p>Note also that some tags are fixed, or preset based on the type of page, and can't be changed as they are not tied to any user-editable field.</p>\n<p>The tables below outline which fields are used to populate the tags for each type of page:</p>\n<h3>Hub level</h3>\n<table style=\"height: 131px;\" width=\"642\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 317.5px;\"><strong>Open Graph Tag</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 317.5px;\"><strong>Twitter Card Tag</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 317.5px;\"><strong>Set by</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 317.5px;\"><code class=\"no-padding\">og:title</code></td>\n<td style=\"width: 317.5px;\"><code class=\"no-padding\">twitter:title</code></td>\n<td style=\"width: 317.5px;\"><em>Appearance &gt;

However, there are <strong>two non-Open Graph/Twitter Card meta tags </strong>that you should know about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">meta name=\"title\"</code> and </li>\n<li><code class=\"no-padding\">meta name=\"description\"</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360054702492/og5.png\" alt=\"og5.png\"></p>\n<p>The reason these two meta tags are important is because they are used by search engines as the title and snippet when the page is shown in search results, like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360054702472/og6.png\" alt=\"og6.png\"></p>\n<p>As a result, we refer to these tags in the Uberflip app as the <strong>SEO Title</strong> and <strong>SEO Description</strong>, or \"meta-title\" and \"meta-description\".</p>\n<p>By default, the meta-title and meta-description tags are set in the same way as the Open Graph and Twitter Card title and description tags, so they will usually be the same. However, if you want, you can set the meta-title and meta-description tags independently to display an <strong>alternative title and description</strong> for any page. To do this, simply set an SEO Title and/or SEO Description for any Hub, Stream, or Item page.

            "body": "<hr>\n<p>Learn how to use Conditional CTA Form Fields and the Label Only Field Type to make your Form CTAs compliant with the GDPR.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Before you Begin</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To use these features, you need to be a member of the <strong>Account Administrator</strong> or <strong>Content Manager </strong>user groups.</li>\n<li>Before you can get started, you'll need to determine which opt-in checkboxes and privacy policy details will need to be added to your Form CTAs.</li>\n<li>You'll also have to set up any corresponding opt-in and privacy policy fields in the Marketing Automation Platform(s) tied to your Form CTAs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What are conditional CTA form fields?</h2>\n<p>Conditional CTA Form Fields (or just conditional fields for short) is a feature available on Form CTAs. The concept is pretty simple: not every user requires the same experience when interacting with a Form CTA. Conditional fields allows you to choose which fields on a Form CTA are shown to a given user, based on whether certain conditions have been met.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What is the Label Only form field?</h2>\n<p>You can specify several different types of fields on a Form CTA, including text, dropdown, etc. The Label Only field type allows you to add a field that consists only of the text label, with no associated input field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How do these features relate to GDPR requirements?</h2>\n<p>The GDPR has specific requirements for the collection and management of data belonging to EU citizens, so you have to design your CTAs accordingly to incorporate opt-ins, a privacy statement, etc.</p>\n<p>Designing to meet these requirements typically makes a Form CTA more complex. If you adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, this would mean presenting the most complex version of the CTA to all visitors to your Hub — including to non-EU visitors, to whom the GDPR requirements don't apply. Doing this could potentially hurt your conversion rates.</p>\n<p>With <strong>conditional fields</strong>, you can tailor the Form CTA experience to your visitors: EU visitors will see a GDPR-compliant version of the CTA, while non-EU versions will see a simplified version.</p>\n<p>And, using the <strong>Label Only field type</strong>, you can display a note about your privacy policy along with a link to it right within the CTA. Combined with conditional fields, you can also make this note appear only for EU visitors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How does this work in practice?</h2>\n<p>To illustrate how this works, consider an example Form CTA with the following fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First Name</li>\n<li>Last Name</li>\n<li>Company</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the Hub visitor interacting with this Form CTA is an EU citizen, we would need to <em>also</em> display a privacy policy on the CTA, as well as one or more opt-in checkboxes. With Conditional Fields, we can simply add a checkbox to the Form CTA, like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First Name</li>\n<li>Last Name</li>\n<li>Company</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n<li><strong>[  ] I'm an EU Citizen</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>By tying this checkbox to Conditional Fields, we can display the necessary opt-ins and privacy policy links for GDPR compliance when an EU citizen checks the box. The result might look like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360015953632/itemeditorimage_5b069a1cccbc3.png\" alt=\"itemeditorimage_5b069a1cccbc3.png\" width=\"282\" height=\"370\"></p>\n<p>Below, we'll show you how you can do this with your own Form CTAs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Create a condition for conditional fields</h2>\n<p>To create conditional fields on Form CTAs, you first have to create a condition: when this condition is met, the conditional fields will be displayed.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Uberflip account and use the <strong>Hubs</strong> menu to select the Hub you want to work in.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Calls-To-Action</strong>, then click on <strong>Form Calls-To-Action</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the list on the right, find the <strong>Form CTA</strong> you want to modify and click on it to open it in the CTA Editor (or create a new Form CTA).</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Layout</strong> button, and find the section labeled <strong>Form Fields</strong>, then click on <strong>Manage</strong> next to the Form Fields heading:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360015953852/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>In the pop-up window that appears, click on +<strong>Add New</strong>.<br><br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360015953912/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>You can now add a new field that will form the condition to be met.

It assumes a general familiarity with web servers and related concepts and terminology.</li>\n<li>In most organizations, the person who can perform the steps described in this article will be a <strong>web administrator</strong> (or similar).</li>\n<li>This guide assumes that you have <strong>reverse proxy capability</strong> available and set up on your website. This can be implemented in various forms; specific requirements are laid out below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZGJWDH56DT7QRXCNNG\">What This Guide is About</h2>\n<p>You have likely been provided this guide by your organization's Uberflip administrator. Uberflip is a SaaS provider that helps Marketing and Sales departments to create curated content experiences for prospects and customers. These content experiences are managed and delivered through a web-based interface called a Hub.</p>\n<p>For user experience and SEO reasons, we recommend unifying your Uberflip Hub with your website, which means delivering it on a URL that is part of your website's root domain. However, because Uberflip is SaaS, Hubs are hosted on servers managed by Uberflip. One way to solve this problem is to use a reverse proxy to integrate your Hub and your website.</p>\n<p>This article explains how to set up a reverse proxy so that it sends requests for a designated subdirectory (and anything under it) to a specific origin server. The ultimate purpose of doing this is to allow visitors to your website to request a certain subdirectory (e.g. <em>www.mycompany.com/resources</em>) and be served content from an Uberflip Hub that is hosted outside your website's hosting infrastructure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZG828PPDHK1K4XR6MM\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>We don't require any specific type of reverse proxy, so you can choose the most appropriate option for your situation based on your preference or what you already have in place. The possible options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <em>Content Delivery Network</em> (CDN), e.g. <em>Amazon CloudFront, Akamai, Cloudflare (Enterprise), Limelight</em>, etc.</li>\n<li>A dedicated <em>load balancer</em> or <em>reverse proxy server</em>, e.g. <em>HAProxy</em> or <em>NGINX</em>.</li>\n<li>A reverse proxy/gateway <em>module </em>on your web server, e.g. <em>mod_proxy</em> on Apache HTTP Server.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More information about these options (along with our recommendations) can be found in <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018964792\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p>No matter which option you go with, your specific reverse proxy must support the following functionality to be used with Uberflip:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Proxy requests for a subdirectory and anything below it (e.g. <em>http://www.mycompany.com/hub/*</em>) to a specific origin server.</li>\n<li>Proxy GET, POST, HEAD and OPTIONS requests (at minimum these types required; others do not have to be excluded as they will be ignored).</li>\n<li>Disable caching of the origin server (for CDNs).</li>\n<li>Pass requests to the origin server intact, i.e. with the full request URL, and all original headers/parameters included.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Specific reverse proxy services that are known <strong>not</strong> to work are listed in the <a href=\"#h_311895249391544624336650\"><em>Frequently Asked Questions</em></a> section at the end of this article.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZGV7N8RWA3P3Z5J3TG\">Configure the Reverse Proxy</h2>\n<p>As the exact steps needed to configure your reverse proxy will vary depending on the type of reverse proxy you are using, we're not able to provide detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to do this. Instead, we will describe the general setup objectives you need to achieve, as well as the reasoning behind them.</p>\n<p>The reverse proxy technology you are using will have its own documentation that outlines the exact steps you need to follow to get the desired result. Use the objectives below to guide you as you configure the settings for your particular reverse proxy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZG0PJQSEXB3WKXRRKH\"> </h3>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZGHKDEV6JFJC18RSK9\">Objective 1: Proxy Requests for a Subdirectory to a Specific Origin Server</h3>\n<p><strong>What you need to do:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a rule in your reverse proxy. The rule must:\n<ul>\n<li>Apply to any request that involves a specific subdirectory on your root domain (including any further subdirectories nested under the designated subdirectory)</li>\n<li>Pass all requests that meet this criterion to a specific origin server</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The <em>subdirectory</em> that will form the basis of the rule will be provided by your organization's Uberflip admin (e.g. <em>http://www.mycompany.com/hub/</em>)</li>\n<li>Specify the following <em>origin server</em>:\n<ul>\n<li><em>https://read.uberflip.com/</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why you need to do it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The underlying goal is to make your Uberflip Hub accessible under a subdirectory on your website's root domain</li>\n<li>Uberflip Hubs are actually hosted on Uberflip's servers, accessible via the URL <em>https://read.uberflip.com/</em>\n</li>\n<li>To serve a Hub when a visitor requests the specified subdirectory, you need to identify those requests and automatically send them to <em>https://read.uberflip.com/</em>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZGAJ99JSSWCWV7F85Y\">Objective 2: Ensure the Required Request Methods are Passed</h3>\n<p><strong>What you need to do:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your rule must be able to pass all requests that use the following methods:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>GET</li>\n<li>POST</li>\n<li>HEAD</li>\n<li>OPTION</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You do not need to set up a rule that passes <em>only</em> requests using these methods. Requests using any other method will simply be ignored by the Uberflip origin server.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why you need to do it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To ensure full Hub functionality, at minimum Uberflip needs to receive any and all requests that use the 4 methods (\"verbs\") listed above</li>\n<li>Therefore, your reverse proxy must be capable of passing these types of requests without omitting/filtering any</li>\n<li>Requests using any other method can also be passed safely, as they will simply be ignored by the Uberflip server</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZG7XB03XBRDAYP0QX0\">Objective 3: Ensure Requests are Passed Intact</h3>\n<p><strong>What you need to do:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your reverse proxy and/or your rule must be set up in such a way that requests passed to the Uberflip origin server are passed through as-is</li>\n<li>This means that the origin server must receive the original request exactly as it was sent by the client — the reverse proxy may not make any changes to it</li>\n<li>Some reverse proxies <em>add</em> header fields that were not part of the original request. This is fine, provided the change is only <em>additive </em>(i.e. no part of the original request is <em>modified</em> or <em>removed</em> as a result)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why you need to do it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics around the way that visitors interact with your Uberflip Hub are very important to your Marketing department</li>\n<li>To report accurate data, Uberflip requires all of the information passed through by the client, as it allows us to identify users and their behaviour</li>\n<li>Passing the requests intact also allows us to ensure the correct Hub (and content within the Hub) is served to the client</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZG9K6PDQSRQBYEEVE5\">Objective 4: Enable TLS (\"SSL\") Between Your Reverse Proxy and the Origin Server</h3>\n<p><strong>What you need to do:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requests passed from the reverse proxy server to the origin server must use a secure connection (HTTPS over TLS)<br>\n<ul>\n<li>This is still commonly referred to as \"SSL\", but in the interest of clarity, you should specifically use the current standard TLS protocol rather than the deprecated SSL protocol</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This specifically refers to the connection between the proxy server and the origin server only, i.e. it is a requirement even if your website does not use HTTPS</li>\n<li>The connection will be terminated at the origin server and is therefore covered by Uberflip's certificate, so you do not need to provide a certificate</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why you need to do it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Uberflip origin server (https://read.uberflip.com/) is configured to require HTTPS, so the connection to the reverse proxy should be set to use it</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZGR4TQ2AN4D15WXCBF\">Objective 5: Disable Caching of the Origin Server (If Needed)</h3>\n<p><strong>What you need to do:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your reverse proxy may support caching of origin servers (i.e. if you are using a CDN)</li>\n<li>If so, you must specifically disable this feature for the Uberflip origin server</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why you need to do it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>As with the \"requests must be passed intact\" requirement, this is to ensure accurate Hub metrics</li>\n<li>If caching is enabled, the proxy server will serve requests from its own cache of the origin server</li>\n<li>When a request is served from cache, the request is never passed to the origin server, so Uberflip does not receive the request headers requires to produce metrics</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZGDSH2PGZED79ATQ7C\">Confirm Basic Functionality</h2>\n<p>When you have configured your reverse proxy to meet the objectives outlined above, you can test whether it is working by visiting the subdirectory URL in any browser. If you set everything up successfully, your Uberflip Hub (or, in certain cases, a testing Hub) should load.</p>\n<p>Once this test passes, you can notify your organization's Uberflip admin so that they can complete the remaining setup and testing steps.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZGR95GGKR4WX3DGN7P\">Common Problems</h2>\n<p>Below are some of the configuration problems we see most often with reverse proxies. These issues will generally either make the Hub inaccessible, or will break important functionality, so it's important to try and avoid them while setting up your reverse proxy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZHSSVM40QEMXC6CQ8A\">Removing HTTP headers and changing the request method</h3>\n<p>Some proxy servers can be set up to change components of HTTP messages, including the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods\">method</a> and the values in the HTTP request and response <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers\">header fields</a>.</p>\n<p>However, various functions of Uberflip Hubs rely on our origin server receiving this information exactly as it was sent by the client's browser (and vice-versa): for example, the <em>User-Agent</em> and <em>Cookie</em> header fields, among others, are used to collect visitor metrics.</p>\n<p>If your proxy server changes the HTTP messages in this way, this can either break particular functionality, cause security risks to the client's browser, or cause the Hub to stop working altogether. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the proxy rewrites POST requests to GET requests, functionality like CTA submission and progressive profiling will break</li>\n<li>If the proxy modifies or removes header fields like <em>Accept-Encoding</em>, the server may return an encoding that the client's browser can't display</li>\n<li>If the proxy changes the <em>Host</em> header field, the Hub can't be displayed at all (see <a href=\"#h_09d37ceb-cad6-47fb-85fd-b549a973b94f\" target=\"_self\">below</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, you should make sure that your proxy server is configured to <strong>not</strong> modify either the request or response messages in any way (though it may add its own headers if needed).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_09d37ceb-cad6-47fb-85fd-b549a973b94f\">Changing the value of the <em>Host</em> header field</h3>\n<p>In addition to generally ensuring that your reverse proxy is not changing <em>any</em> HTTP headers, it's particularly important that the <em>Host</em> header on HTTP requests is not modified in any way. When a request for a Hub reaches our origin server at <em>read.uberflip.com</em>, the server relies on the hostname listed in the original request to figure out which Hub the request is intended for. If this hostname has been changed by the reverse proxy, our server has no way of knowing which Hub to serve in response to the request, since the information it needs to do that is missing.</p>\n<p>Some reverse proxies (such as Apache's <em>mod_proxy</em>) will change the hostname on the request header by default, and replace it with the hostname of the origin server. For example, it would change</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">Host: www.mycompany.com/hub/</code></p>\n<p>to</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">Host: read.uberflip.com/</code></p>\n<p>With proxies that do this, you would generally need to specifically override this behavior by changing a setting (in <em>mod_proxy's</em> case, this setting is called <a href=\"https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypreservehost\"><em>ProxyPreserveHost</em></a>) to ensure that the original host is kept on the proxied request.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZH6E52AMC9YW5QGP5Q\">Removing part of the request path</h3>\n<p>Keep in mind that the way your proxy works might cause part of the request path to be removed. For instance, consider this <em>mod_proxy</em> <a href=\"https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypass\"><em>ProxyPass</em></a> directive:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"http\">ProxyPass \"/hub/\" \"https://read.uberflip.com\"</code></pre>\n<p>This directive, as written, would redirect any request with <em>/hub/</em> in its path to <em>https://read.uberflip.com</em>. However, this would not work, because a request like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"http\">GET /hub/blog/ HTTP1.1<br>Host: www.mycompany.com</code></pre>\n<p>would be proxied to <em>https://read.uberflip.com</em> as:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"http\">GET /blog/ HTTP1.1<br>Host: www.mycompany.com</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, the <em>/hub</em><em>/</em> part of the path has been removed from the proxied request, so you end up with <code class=\"no-padding\">GET /blog/</code> instead of <code class=\"no-padding\">GET /hub/blog/</code>. Without the full path, Uberflip would be unable to identify the Hub that the request is intended for.</p>\n<p>The reason for this is that a proxy like ProxyPass requires you to specify a full <em>URL</em>, <strong>not</strong> just the origin server <em>domain. </em>ProxyPass works by appending the requested path to the URL you provide, but<em> </em>does so <em>after</em> removing the part of the path specified in the directive (e.g. /hub/).</p>\n<p>To avoid this issue, you would need to ensure that you set up your proxy in such a way that no part of the original request path is removed when the request is proxied to <em>read.uberflip.com</em>. In the case of a ProxyPass directive specifically, you would need to include the part of the path to be matched in the URL as well, like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Incorrect: </strong><code class=\"no-padding\">ProxyPass \"/hub/\" \"https://read.uberflip.com\"</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Correct: </strong><code class=\"no-padding\">ProxyPass \"/hub/\" \"https://read.uberflip.com<strong>/hub/</strong>\"</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HWTHJHZHYRT7B7RCG7PHWCJD\">Enabling caching on the proxy server</h3>\n<p>Some proxy servers, particularly those that are part of CDNs, offer the ability to cache server responses. With this functionality enabled, the proxy server can serve resources it has saved from its own cache, rather than requesting them from the origin server.</p>\n<p>Using a proxy server's cache can have performance benefits for many web properties, but with an Uberflip Hub, doing so will break important functionality. Specifically, client requests must hit the origin server for features like CTAs and visitor metrics to work: if these requests are served from cache, instead, this will result in data loss as you will be unable to collect CTA submissions and metrics.</p>\n<p>If your proxy server does have cache capabilities, you should therefore ensure that it is turned off specifically for any request that is proxied to Uberflip's origin server (though you can still enable it for any other request if desired).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_311895249391544624336650\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: The URL for our Hub is currently <em>[mycompany].uberflip.com</em>, not <em>read.uberflip.com.</em> Why do I set the origin server as <em>read.uberflip.com</em>?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q: I have multiple Hubs that I want to set up on subdirectories. Do I need to specify a different origin server for each one?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> The answer to both of these questions is that, for logistical reasons, we actually serve all Hubs from a single domain: <em>read.uberflip.com</em>.</p>\n<p>Every Hub is linked in the Uberflip interface (<em>Account Settings &gt; Services &gt; Domains</em>) to a particular domain under which it can be accessed — but in fact, each of these Hub domains are just aliases for <em>read.uberflip.com</em>. As a result, visiting any given Hub domain always routes the request to <em>read.uberflip.com. </em>We then simply look up which Hub that domain is linked to in Uberflip's database and serve up the appropriate Hub.</p>\n<p>For this reason, when you set up a reverse proxy to point requests for a Hub's domain at an origin server, you <strong>always</strong> specify the origin server as <em>read.uberflip.com: </em>this is the actual underlying server from which <strong>all</strong> Hubs are served.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Q: My website uses HTTPS (SSL/TLS). If I set up a custom domain for my Hub on a subdirectory of my website, do I need to send Uberflip a certificate?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>No, you don't have to send us a certificate in this case. While you do have to send us a certificate if you use a <em>subdomain</em> as your custom domain and want to use HTTPS on it, this is not necessary if your custom domain is a <em>subdirectory</em>. When a client requests the subdirectory for your Hub, the TLS connection is terminated at your domain, because the subdirectory is under that domain. This means that it is covered by your domain's certificate.</p>\n<p>The request is then passed on by your reverse proxy server to the Uberflip origin server (<em>read.uberflip.com</em>). This connection also uses HTTPS, and as it terminates on Uberflip's domain, it is covered by Uberflip's certificate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Are there any specific reverse proxies that do not work with custom domains?<br></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Yes. At present, we have confirmed that the following will not work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer), ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) and Classic Load Balancer. As an alternative, you can use CloudFront, which is confirmed to work and is also part of AWS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will be adding to this list as we identify other reverse proxy services that are not compatible with Uberflip custom domains.</p>"

This is because websites are commonly configured to <strong>prevent their content from being displayed in an iframe</strong>.</p>\n<p>To resolve (or avoid) this issue with websites that you own, you can <strong>configure your website's iframe restrictions to allow exceptions for your Hub</strong>. In this article, we'll look at where those restrictions are typically implemented, and how you can implement the necessary exceptions for your Hub.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">What about third-party websites?</h4>\n<p>If you're having trouble when trying to iframe content from websites that you do <strong>not</strong> control (i.e. websites owned by third parties), your options are more limited. You can't force the third-party website to allow you to iframe their content, so you can either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask the third-party website owner to modify their own iframe restrictions, e.g. if the website is owned by a partner</li>\n<li>Avoid iframing the content and link to it instead</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note also that some websites will not allow iframing of a whole page, but do allow certain elements to be iframed: for example, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en\">YouTube</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/embedded-posts/\">Facebook</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Technical background</h2>\n<p>As a security measure to combat <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking\">clickjacking</a> attacks, website administrators will sometimes configure the following mechanisms to prevent their website from being iframed by another website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code class=\"no-padding\">frame-ancestors</code> directive of a website's Content Security Policy header</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"no-padding\">X-Frame-Options</code> header</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The default configuration of these mechanisms will prevent iframing of the website in all cases, including authorized uses such as embedding content from a website you own into your own Uberflip Hub. To allow for authorized uses while still maintaining protection against unauthorized/malicious use, these mechanisms each support the ability to <strong>selectively disable the restriction</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code class=\"no-padding\">frame-ancestors</code> directive of the Content Security Policy can be configured with a list of excepted URLs, which you can use to define specific URLs that are permitted to iframe your website</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"no-padding\">X-Frame-Options</code> header can be removed from specific pages that you want to be able to iframe</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note: Other clickjacking defense mechanisms</h4>\n<p>In addition to those noted here, there are also other mechanisms to combat clickjacking, such as JavaScript frame-busters/frame-killers. There are too many variations to cover in this article, so be sure to check with your website administrator/web developer: they should be able to advise you if your website uses any such mechanisms,  and how you can adapt the recommendations outlined in this article for your specific setup.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Modify your Content Security Policy <code class=\"no-padding\">frame-ancestors</code> directive</h2>\n<p>If your website uses a <code class=\"no-padding\">Content-Security-Policy</code> header with a <code class=\"no-padding\">frame-ancestors</code> directive, you can <strong>specify exceptions for your Hub URLs</strong> in that directive.</p>\n<p>To do this, ensure the directive is <strong>not</strong> set to <code class=\"no-padding\">'none'</code>, i.e.:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"http\">Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';</code></pre>\n<p>Instead, <strong>set the directive to</strong> <code class=\"no-padding\">'self'</code> and <strong>add the URLs of your Hub(s), </strong>i.e.:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"http\">Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' [Hub URL(s) here];</code></pre>\n<p>See below for guidelines specific to <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018876192\" target=\"_self\">how your Hub's custom domain is set up</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>You can find documentation on how to configure this directive in <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors\">MDN Web Docs: CSP: frame-ancestors</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>For a Hub on a <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018786372\" target=\"_self\">subdomain</a>:</h3>\n<p>Use this configuration if your Hub is on a subdomain like <em>https://hub.mycompany.com/ </em>(this includes Hubs on Uberflip default co-branded subdomains like <em>https://mycompany.uberflip.com/</em>):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"http\">Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'<br>hub.mycompany.com<br>mycompany.uberflip.com;</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace the example URLs (<code class=\"no-padding\">hub.mycompany.com</code> and <code class=\"no-padding\">mycompany.uberflip.com</code>) with your Hub's actual URLs.</li>\n<li>Make sure to include your Hub's default co-branded subdomain URL (similar to <code class=\"no-padding\">mycompany.uberflip.com</code>) in the list — even if you do not actively use it.</li>\n<li>This example is for a single Hub (with the example custom subdomain URL <code class=\"no-padding\">hub.mycompany.com</code>): if you have multiple Hubs, add their URLs as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>For a Hub on a <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019755751\" target=\"_self\">subdirectory</a>:</h3>\n<p>Use this configuration if your Hub is on a subdirectory like <em>https://www.mycompany.com/hub/</em>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"http\">Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'<br>www.mycompany.com/hub<br>mycompany.uberflip.com;</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace the example URLs (<code class=\"no-padding\">www.mycompany.com/hub</code> and <code class=\"no-padding\">mycompany.uberflip.com/</code>) with your Hub's actual URLs.</li>\n<li>Make sure to include your Hub's default co-branded subdomain URL (similar to <code class=\"no-padding\">mycompany.uberflip.com</code>) in the list — even if you do not actively use it.</li>\n<li>This example is for a single Hub (with the example custom subdirectory URL <code class=\"no-padding\">www.mycompany.com/hub</code>): if you have multiple Hubs, add their URLs as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Wildcard option:</h3>\n<p>For both subdomain and subdirectory Hubs, you can also simplify the directive by specifying URLs using wildcards instead, like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"http\">Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'<br>*.mycompany.com<br>mycompany.com/*<br>*.uberflip.com;</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>This will allow iframing on all URLs that match the wildcard, i.e. all subdomains of <code class=\"no-padding\">mycompany.com</code>, all subdirectories of <code class=\"no-padding\">mycompany.com</code>, and all subdomains of <code class=\"no-padding\">uberflip.com</code>.</li>\n<li>Replace all instances of <code class=\"no-padding\">mycompany.com</code> with your actual website/Hub URLs.</li>\n<li>You can remove the non-applicable URL, e.g. remove <code class=\"no-padding\">mycompany.com/*</code> if your Hub uses a subdomain, and vice-versa.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Remove the <code class=\"no-padding\">X-Frame-Options</code> header</h2>\n<p>If your website uses an <code class=\"no-padding\">X-Frame-Options</code> header with a <code class=\"no-padding\">DENY</code> or <code class=\"no-padding\">SAMEORIGIN</code> directive, you will need to <strong>remove this header from any page that you want to be able to iframe in your Hub</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>You can find documentation on how to configure this header on a variety of common web servers technologies in <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">MDN Web Docs: X-Frame-Options</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>While the <code class=\"no-padding\">X-Frame-Options</code> header has an <code class=\"no-padding\">ALLOW-FROM</code> directive, this is obsolete and should <strong>not</strong> be used.</li>\n<li>As recommended by MDN, the <code class=\"no-padding\">Content-Security-Policy</code> header with a <code class=\"no-padding\">frame-ancestors</code> directive is generally preferred to using the <code class=\"no-padding\">X-Frame-Options</code> header, especially as a replacement for the <code class=\"no-padding\">ALLOW-FROM</code> directive.</li>\n<li>If your website uses both the <code class=\"no-padding\">X-Frame-Options</code> header <strong>and</strong> the <code class=\"no-padding\">Content-Security-Policy</code> header, the <code class=\"no-padding\">X-Frame-Options</code> header will take precedence in Safari and Internet Explorer.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

For example, if a visitor is identified by 6sense as being in the <em>Software</em> industry, the app can automatically display just Items that have been tagged as relevant to that industry.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Automatically set a visitor's organization logo on a Stream</strong>: 6sense Personalizer can use data from 6sense to automatically populate the visitor’s organization logo on Streams that use the <em>Banner+Logo </em>template.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Automatically personalize content text: </strong>Simply insert variables into content titles, descriptions, body text, CTAs, etc., and 6sense Personalizer will automatically insert the appropriate values form the visitor's 6sense data into to personalize content for the visitor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Setup: Enabling Item tags for Custom Code</h2>\n<p>6sense Personalizer uses <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\" target=\"_self\">Uberflip Item tags</a> to personalize content for individual visitors. By default, these tags are only displayed in the Uberflip app, and are not included when an Item is viewed in the Hub's front end.

If you have also configured Account Level settings, Hub Level settings will override them for that specific Hub.</li>\n<li>Any settings you configure at the <strong>Stream Level</strong> will apply to <strong>that Stream</strong> <strong>only</strong>. If you have also configured Account and/or Hub Level settings, Stream Level settings will override them for that specific Stream.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of this app's settings can only be configured at certain levels.

For example, if a visitor's 6sense data indicates that their industry is <em>Financial Services</em>, then the Stream will be filtered to show Items that you have tagged as relating to the financial services industry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order for this functionality to work, you must set up 6sense <strong>Attribute</strong> <strong>Tags</strong> in your Uberflip account, and add them to all Items in Streams where 6sense Personalizer is active. See <a href=\"#h_01F8GK3A2H6R3FDZ1246DEKMK2\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Using Attribute Tags</a> for more information.</li>\n<li>When <em>Filter Items by Tags</em> is enabled, an Item must have at least one Attribute Tag matching <em>any </em>attribute in the visitor's 6sense data to be displayed. Items that do not have at least one matching Attribute Tag (or which have no Attribute Tags) will not be displayed.</li>\n<li>If an Item has multiple Attribute Tags, only one of these tags needs to match the visitor's data for that Item to be displayed.</li>\n<li>By default, the minimum number of matching Items that will be displayed is one. If no Items in a Stream have Attribute Tags that match the visitor's 6sense data, <strong>all</strong> Items in the Stream will be shown (to avoid showing the visitor an empty Stream).<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Using the <a href=\"#h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\" target=\"_self\"><em>Show Always Tag</em></a> changes this behavior. If you use the Show Always Tag, then only Items that have the Show Always Tag will be displayed in this situation (rather than all Items in the Stream).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When a Stream is filtered, the order in which the Items are shown will still be the same as in the original (unfiltered) Stream, except with the filtered Items hidden. For example, if five Items in a Stream are in the order 1-2-3-4-5 and Items 1 and 4 are filtered out, the Stream will still display the remaining Items in the order 2-3-5.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"h_01F8GK3A2H6R3FDZ1246DEKMK2\">Using Attribute Tags</h4>\n<p>To use the <strong><a href=\"#h_01F8E0M3SDAAXHD9BY1W6Z95BW\" target=\"_self\">Filter Items by Tags</a></strong> functionality, you must add <strong>Attribute Tags</strong> to all Items that appear in Streams where 6sense Personalizer is enabled. Attribute Tags are specially-formatted tags which you use to indicate to 6sense Personalizer which content Items should be displayed if a visitor has a given attribute in their 6sense data.</p>\n<p>To apply an Attribute Tag to an Item, simply add it to the Item in the same way as a normal Item Tag (see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\">Use Tags on your Items</a> for instructions)<a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\" target=\"_self\">.</a> Attribute Tags use the following structure:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">6sense.[attribute].[subattribute].[value]</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">[attribute]</code> is the 6sense main attribute, one of:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">company</code> for firmographic and technographic information</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">scores</code>  for predictive analytics around buying stages and ICP fit</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">segments</code> for dynamically customizable attributes that can be a combination of <code class=\"no-padding\">company</code> and <code class=\"no-padding\">scores</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">[subattribute]</code> is a 6sense secondary attribute that corresponds to the main attribute, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">industry</code>, or <code class=\"no-padding\">buying_stage</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">[value]</code>is the attribute’s specific value, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">Biotech</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, you could add the Attribute Tag <code class=\"no-padding\">6sense.company.industry.Biotech</code> to any content Items that are relevant to the Biotech industry. This would then cause those Items to be displayed if a visitor’s <code class=\"no-padding\">company.industry</code> attribute in their 6sense data is set to <code class=\"no-padding\">Biotech</code>.</p>\n<p>Before you can begin adding Attribute Tags to your Items, you must first create them in your Uberflip account. You can easily create Attribute Tags using the <strong>6sense Tag Manager</strong> that is included with this app. For instructions, see <a href=\"#h_0c4d72cb-4bfe-4cc7-a643-74bea841a750\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Creating Attribute Tags with 6sense Tag Manager</strong></a>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>If you want to use <em>Filter Items by Tags</em>, it's not necessary to tag all the Items in your Hub! To get started, try tagging just the Items in the Streams where this app is enabled.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\">Using the Show Always Tag</h4>\n<p>You can choose to always display certain Items, regardless of the visitor's 6sense data. To do this, use the <strong>Show Always Tag</strong>:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">6sense.show</code></p>\n<p>This tag is created automatically when you install 6sense Personalizer. To use it, simply add it to any Items that you want to always be displayed in Streams where 6sense Personalizer is active (provided the Item has been added to the Stream). This is useful for content that is relevant to a very wide audience and should be shown to all visitors, as well as to avoid instances where only one or two Items would be shown in the Stream based on Attribute Tags alone.</p>\n<p>If you use the Show Always Tag, keep in mind that the filtered Stream will still respect the Item order set for the full Stream. As a result, we recommend placing Items with the Show Always Tag either at the beginning or end of the Stream (depending on the content).</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>Do not delete the Show Always Tag from your Uberflip account, even if you don't use it on any Items! 6sense Personalizer requires this tag to be present to enable key app functionality.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>6sense Personalizer filters not just Items on the main Stream page, but also the additional Items that are displayed in the <em>Next/Previous Item</em> area and the <em>Other Content in This Stream</em> carousel when viewing an Item in that Stream. While viewing an Item, these areas will be filtered in the same way as the main Stream page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the carousel, filtered Items will take priority, and any additional free slots in the carousel (after all filtered Items have been displayed) will be filled with non-filtered Items from the same Stream</li>\n<li>If no next or previous filtered Item is available, the <em>Next/Previous Item</em> area will be hidden</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_3c68ada0-145d-4af1-91b7-b444ec5d1bb9\">Swap Logo</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level | Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> This setting is used to control 6sense Personalizer's dynamic logo functionality.</p>\n<p>When this setting is turned on, the app will use a visitor's 6sense data to search <a href=\"https://clearbit.com/logo\">Clearbit</a> for the logo of the visitor's organization. If a logo is found, it is automatically inserted into the <em>Prospect Logo</em> space on Marketing/Sales Streams that use the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020637332\" target=\"_self\"><em>Banner+Logo</em> <em>template</em></a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the setting <a href=\"#h_1b875855-b03a-4e40-98f5-d6b4c66e0de5\" target=\"_self\"><em>Remove Logos When No Match Found</em></a> to determine what happens if no matching logo can be found.</li>\n<li>If the <em>confidence</em> attribute for a visitor's 6sense data does not match or exceed the <a href=\"#h_01FH8Q4DT0HM3YSNH13YVYMVS8\" target=\"_self\"><em>Minimum Confidence</em> level you have set</a>, this setting is automatically disabled for that visitor. As a result, the visitor's company as provided by 6sense will be ignored, and the <em>Prospect Logo</em> that you have set for the Stream will be shown instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>For the <strong>Swap Logo</strong> functionality to work, you must enable the <em>Banner+Logo</em> <em>template</em> <strong>and</strong> specify a \"fallback\" <em>Prospect Logo</em> under the <em>Appearance</em> tab on any Marketing or Sales Stream where you want to use this app. The fallback logo will not be displayed if 6sense Personalizer can find a logo for the visitor, but this feature will not activate if no logo is set. We recommend using a generic logo for this purpose (e.g. a logo that just says \"You\" or similar).</p>\n<p>We also recommend specifying a default <em>Banner Title</em> under the <em>Appearance </em>tab to be displayed in case no logo is found and the logos are hidden from the banner. If you do not specify a <em>Banner Title</em>, only a blank header (or <em>Banner Image</em>, if specified) will be shown.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_1b875855-b03a-4e40-98f5-d6b4c66e0de5\">Remove Logos When No Match Found</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level | Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> (enabled by default if you have turned on the <a href=\"#h_3c68ada0-145d-4af1-91b7-b444ec5d1bb9\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Swap Logo</strong></a> setting).

The <strong>6sense Tag Manager</strong> makes this easy by allowing you to browse and select Attribute Tags from 6sense, then add them to your Uberflip account with just a few clicks.</p>\n<h3>Create Attribute Tags</h3>\n<p>6sense Tag Manager is automatically installed along with 6sense Personalizer, and you can use it to create Attribute Tags at any time.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to <a href=\"https://app.uberflip.com/\" target=\"_self\"><strong>app.uberflip.com</strong></a> and navigate to any Hub in your account.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Note: </strong>Because all Uberflip tags are created at the Account Level, Attribute Tags you create with 6sense Tag Manager will be available in all Hubs under your Uberflip account, regardless of the Hub you create them in.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In the left sidebar menu, click on <strong>6sense Tag Manager</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4403336481037/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>6sense Tag Manager will appear to the right, where you will see two lists: <strong>available 6sense attributes</strong> will appear on the left, while <strong>Uberflip tags created from 6sense attributes (i.e. Attribute Tags)</strong> will appear on the right <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4403336599309/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Note: </strong>The list on the right only shows created 6sense <em>Attribute</em> <em>Tags</em>, not all tags in your account. If you have not yet created any Attribute Tags, this list will be empty by default — even if you have and use other Uberflip tags.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Browse the <em>6sense Attributes </em>list to see all available attributes that you can add as Attribute Tags to your Uberflip account.

These fields are used to populate the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612952\" target=\"_self\">Open Graph and Twitter Card tags</a> that social platforms use to generate link previews, and any text you put in them will appear in the preview — including the placeholder text itself, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">{6sense.company.name}</code> instead of the relevant company name. Instead, use the <a href=\"#h_01F8GJG4EXVVHW7J595PF4J7MS\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Dynamic</strong> <strong>Stream Title </strong></a>and <a href=\"#h_01F8GJGCE64E1RKJW2D0Y4W1BK\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Dynamic Stream Description </strong></a>fields to personalize Stream titles and descriptions with <strong>Search &amp; Replace</strong> variables.</li>\n<li>For Marketing and Sales Streams, we recommend enabling the <em><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020637332-Personalize-a-Marketing-or-Sales-Stream\">Banner+Logo template</a></em> under the Stream's <em>Appearance</em> tab, as this will allow you to use the <strong><a href=\"#h_3c68ada0-145d-4af1-91b7-b444ec5d1bb9\" target=\"_self\">Swap Logo</a></strong> functionality. If you select this template, you should also enable the <strong>Hide Stream Title</strong> option and specify a <strong>Banner Title</strong> (also under the <em>Appearance</em> tab). There are two benefits to doing this:\n<ul>\n<li>If the <strong><a href=\"#h_1b875855-b03a-4e40-98f5-d6b4c66e0de5\" target=\"_self\">Remove Logos When No Match Found</a></strong> option is turned on and no logo matches are found, the Banner Title will be shown on the banner instead (rather than an empty banner image).</li>\n<li>If you intend to share the Stream on social media, you can put a placeholder in the Banner Title field (as this isn't shown in the social media preview), but not in the regular Stream Title field (which is shown on social media). In other words, this allows you to personalize the title that a visitor to the Stream sees, without the placeholder text appearing when the same Stream is shared on a social media platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For all Streams and Items that you don't plan to share on social media, but which you expect to be indexed by Google, we recommend using the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612892\" target=\"_self\"><strong>SEO Title and SEO Description fields</strong></a>. These allow you to specify alternative titles and descriptions for your Streams and Items when they appear on Google search result pages. You can use these fields to ensure that any placeholders you put in a Stream's or Item's title/description do not appear when that Stream or Item appears on Google.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>If you experience problems with this app's functionality, this may be due to corrupted data. To resolve the issue, try clearing your browser's cache (or try using the app in Incognito Mode to see if that resolves the issue).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>For developers</h2>\n<p>Because this app manipulates a large portion of Stream and Item pages, a race condition can occur, which can cause other JavaScript <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_self\">Custom Code</a> running on the same page to malfunction. </p>\n<p>If your JS code performs other manipulations on pages where this app is active, you should ensure your code is set to run <strong>after</strong> 6sense Personalizer to avoid problems. To help you do this, a <strong>callback functio</strong><strong>n </strong>is built into the app that will be called once the app has finished executing its own code.</p>\n<p>To leverage the callback function, create a function named <code class=\"no-padding\">ufPersonalizerCallback</code> in your own custom code and place your JS inside it. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;<br>var ufPersonalizerCallback = function(){<br> /** Your JS **/<br>};<br>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>"

To learn about working with Form CTAs in general, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020989871\">this article</a>. In addition, you can find information and instructions specific to form fields in <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021266571\">this article</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About hidden fields on Form CTAs</h2>\n<p>When you set up a Form CTA and customize the form fields that appear on it, you can choose among several different types of fields. Most of these are self-explanatory, such as text, dropdown, etc. But one that isn't quite as straightforward at first glance is the <strong>hidden</strong> field type. As the name suggests, a hidden field is unlike the other types because it's not user-facing. Instead, its purpose is to help automate tracking and attribution.</p>\n<p>Here's how it works: whenever a visitor to your Hub submits a Form CTA, the data they entered into the form fields is used to populate a lead profile in your Marketing Automation Platform (MAP). In many cases, it can be really helpful to add contextual information to a lead profile, such as where the lead was referred from, or if the CTA they used was part of a particular campaign.</p>\n<p>This is where hidden fields come in. You can use a hidden field to pass a value of your choice to a specified field in your MAP each time the CTA is submitted. This value can be a fixed text string (such as a campaign name, marketing persona, etc.), or you can automatically populate the hidden field with a URL query string (like a UTM string). In other words, you can use hidden fields to submit information with a CTA that the visitor would not submit themselves, and which can help you track related metrics like the effectiveness of your campaigns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_45949738991546615692418\">Set up a hidden field with a fixed value</h2>\n<p>The general process for creating a hidden field is exactly the same as for any other form field type, and is described in detail <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021266571\">here</a>. In this article, we will look only at configuring the options specific to hidden fields.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to use hidden fields is to use a fixed value. You specify a value of your choice, and this same value gets passed through every time the CTA is submitted.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Open the CTA Editor </strong>for the Form CTA on which you want to use hidden fields and open the <strong>Manage Fields </strong>menu (<em>Form CTA Editor &gt; Layout &gt; Form Fields &gt; Manage</em>).</li>\n<li>Add a new field, and begin by using the <strong>Search</strong> box to locate the field in your MAP where you want to send the value from the hidden field. When you have the field you want, click on <strong>Apply</strong>. In the example below, we've chosen the <em>Persona</em> field in HubSpot to pass through a value representing the lead's marketing persona:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018312392/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"456\" height=\"271\">\n</li>\n<li>If you want, use the <strong>Field label</strong> box to change the \"display name\" of this field, or leave it as the default (it'll only be visible to you).</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Field type</strong>, use the dropdown to select<strong> Hidden:</strong> You'll now see some additional options appear:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018186071/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"340\" height=\"250\">\n</li>\n<li>Type the value you want to pass to your MAP into the <strong>Hidden value</strong> field. This is the value that will be sent to the MAP field you chose every time the CTA is submitted. In the example below, we want to send the value <strong>Demand Jenn</strong> to the <strong>Persona</strong> field in the MAP:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018186311/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Make sure the box next to <strong>Allow query string values to populate this field</strong> is left <strong>unchecked</strong>. This is used if you want to use a query string value instead of a fixed text value (<a href=\"#h_174882557551546554101287\">see below</a>).<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018186331/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Save</strong> to save your new hidden form field. Back in the Form CTA Editor, don't forget to check the box next to the field under the <strong>Form Fields</strong> section of the <strong>Layout</strong> tab, as it will be unchecked by default right after you add it:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018186871/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>That's it! The fixed value will now automatically be passed to your MAP when a visitor submits this Form CTA.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_174882557551546554101287\">Set up a hidden field with a query string parameter value</h2>\n<p>Alternatively, you can choose to automatically populate hidden fields with query string parameter values. To learn how to do that, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021975011\">this article</a>.</p>"

best practices</span></h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HBX40DK67QT4F72QR1CB4MZY\">Stream banner images</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stream banners dynamically resize to adjust to different screen sizes and devices. As a result, the recommended size above is a general starting point, and not all of the image will be visible on all devices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banners are always displayed as 200 px high, and are adjusted horizontally to fit the width of the screen as needed. Assuming the banner image is 200 px high, this works as follows:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the </span><strong>screen is narrower</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than the width of the banner image, the image will be cropped equally from the left and right sides to the width of the screen, while remaining centered:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360016071271\" alt=\"How_to_Optimize_Your_Banner_Images_for_Stream_Templates.png\" width=\"548\" height=\"131\"></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the </span><strong>screen is wider</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than the width of the banner image, the image will be stretched to the width of the screen. To avoid distortion, the image will maintain the same aspect ratio, so it will look slightly \"zoomed in\" in these cases.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HBX40DK649PF1FQCNPNSBWNC\"><strong> Stream banner best practices:</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Size your stream banner images so that they are 200 px tall, and wider than most screens (approx. 1920px) on which they will be displayed. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you incorporate logos or key graphics in your banner image, make sure they are centered and no more than 30% of the image's width.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you intend to use a logo in your banner, we suggest leveraging the <em>Banner+Logo</em> logo image option, and applying a more abstract background image (such as a pattern).</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HBX40DK61ZGRN8YMAH1KWTKS\">Tile Thumbnails &amp; CTA Background Images</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to Stream banners, Hub Item Tiles are responsive, and resize automatically to fit different screen sizes. By default, standard Tiles are </span><strong>250 px wide by 330 px high</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an aspect ratio of </span><strong>1.32:1</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There are two situations in which Tiles can be a non-standard size:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<strong>Highlighted Tiles: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When using the \"Highlight first Item\" Hubs Lab feature, the first tile will be enlarged to approx. 4x standard size, </span><strong>520 px wide by 680 px high</strong>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<strong>Mobile devices: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile devices are handled differently depending on if your Hub uses Front end V1 or V2 (see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051466431\" target=\"_self\">how to know which Front End your Hub uses</a>?)<br></span>\n<div class=\"accordion accordion--default\">\n<div class=\"accordion__item\">\n<div class=\"accordion__item-title\"><strong>Front End V1</strong></div>\n<div class=\"accordion__item-content\">\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>560px wide screens and under:</strong></li>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\">Tiles maintain a fixed height of 370px, but adjust their width to that of the container</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">The <strong>thumbnail image</strong> and <strong>title/description panel</strong> also maintain fixed heights as the width of the tile changes<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">This means that the aspect ratio of the thumbnail image changes depending on viewport width, with the title/description panel of the tile cropping the thumbnail image from the bottom edge</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">Because of this, images can be displayed as wide as 518.39x282 at a viewport width of 560px, but with only around 50% visible (effectively 518.39x152.06) due to the lower half being hidden by the title/description panel</li>\n</ul>\n<li class=\"li1\">\n<strong>561px screens and above:</strong> 250x136 image thumbnails</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"accordion__item\">\n<div class=\"accordion__item-title\"><strong>Front End V2</strong></div>\n<div class=\"accordion__item-content\">\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">\n<strong>420px wide screens and under: </strong>250x136 image thumbnails</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">\n<strong>421px to 560px wide screens: </strong>350x190.39 image thumbnails</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">\n<strong>561px wide screens and above: </strong>250x136 tile images tiles, displayed in multiple columns depending on screen size</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HBX40DK6F34Q3QDKW26TWAJH\"><strong>Tile Thumbnail and CTA background best practices:</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because thumbnails for both standard and highlighted Tiles have similar aspect ratios (1.32:1 vs 1.31:1), the same image generally works well for both sizes.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When designing images to be used as Tile thumbnails or CTA backgrounds, avoid placing important elements (such as text) within the lower 15-20% of the image.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you use logos or key graphics in the image, make sure they are centered and in the top 50% of the image.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>"

But they're only the tip of the iceberg: behind these dashboards is a mountain of raw data, and <strong>Explore</strong> helps you to unlock its full potential by giving you direct access.</p>\n<p>Using Explore, you can create custom reports tailored specifically to your organization's needs. This means you can go much deeper than the stock dashboards and reports, allowing you to uncover all kinds of valuable insights, and find answers to even the most hyper-specific business questions.</p>\n<p>To give you an idea of the kinds of things you can learn, here is a sampling of actual questions that Uberflip customers have asked us, and which Explore can answer:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Which of my content Items are getting traffic from Google and other sources/mediums each month, and how much traffic?</li>\n<li>I have content Items that I've added to multiple Streams. Are those Items getting more traffic in certain Streams, and if so, which ones?</li>\n<li>I use query string (UTM) parameters on my external links. Can I see how specific parameters are driving inbound views to my Hub?</li>\n<li>I want to know when progressively profiled CTAs are being filled — how many days does it take on average for a lead to be fully profiled?</li>\n<li>Can I see an SEO breakdown of all Items in my Hub, including whether Items that need canonical URLs actually have them?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're looking for answers to these or similar kinds of questions, Explore can help you find them. In this article, we'll look at the key concepts you need to know to use Explore, and will walk through the process of creating your first custom report from start to finish.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Data exploration in Uberflip Analytics: a quick primer</h2>\n<p>Getting started with a data exploration tool like Explore can be a little intimidating. Here's a quick primer to get you up to speed with everything you need to know to be successful.</p>\n<h3>You can't break anything</h3>\n<p>The first and most important thing to know is that <strong>Explore is non-destructive</strong>: even if you stop reading right here and just go play around in Explore, you won't be able to break anything. No matter what you do in Explore, you never need to worry that you might delete, corrupt, or otherwise affect your data or the stock dashboards and reports. As a result, you should feel free to experiment with Explore: there's practically no risk, so just try things and see what happens. The best way to learn is to get hands-on, and you can always just wipe the slate clean and start over at any time.</p>\n<h3>Basic terminology and concepts</h3>\n<p>Uberflip Analytics is at its core a <strong>database</strong>, and Explore is a <strong>tool for pulling data</strong> from that database, in order to create custom reports.</p>\n<p>More specifically, Explore is a <strong>query builder</strong>: it helps you to create queries, which are essentially <strong>requests to the database</strong> that tell it exactly what data you want, how to combine that data, and how to present it to you. Whenever you submit a query to the database, the system processes it and builds a report according to your specifications.</p>\n<p>To build queries effectively, it helps to understand <strong>how the database organizes its data</strong>. This structure is known as the <strong>data model</strong>. The Uberflip Analytics data model divides data into three main categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Content</strong>: Contains data that is inherent to your Hub, i.e. metadata about the Hub and its contents. For example, this includes data points like titles and URLs of Streams and Items, CTA IDs, the number of Streams, and so on.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Engagement</strong>: Contains data collected from visitors to your Hub about their behavior as they interact with your content experiences. This includes data points like page views, time on page, click-through rates, etc.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Traffic</strong>: Contains data collected from visitors to your Hub about about the visitors themselves. This includes data points like where in the world your visitors are located, what devices they use, and how they got to your Hub.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Enrichment</strong>: Allows you to import company and contact information from your integrated marketing automation platform to enrich Uberflip data. This information is displayed in the form of dashboards in the Uberflip platform and can be used to make marketing specific decisions to impact your organization’s growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Within each of these categories, the data model also distinguishes between two data types, <strong>dimensions</strong> and <strong>measures</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>measure</strong> represents data that is <strong>quantitative</strong>. As the name suggests, this is data you can <em>measure</em> using numbers, and to which you can apply mathematical operations (like finding the average, or the total). An example of a measure in Uberflip Analytics would be <em>Page Views</em>, which is a count of the number of times pages in your Hub were viewed.</li>\n<li>A <strong>dimension</strong> represents data that is <strong>qualitative</strong>. This is data that can't be measured or counted; instead, it's data that adds <em>context</em> to the numbers. An example of a dimension in Uberflip Analytics would be <em>Item Title</em>, which consists of the names of all Item pages in your Hub.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Building queries and generating reports</h3>\n<p>When you select a dimension or measure to include in your query, you are essentially specifying that its data should be displayed as a table column in your report. The key thing to remember with dimensions and measures is that <strong><em>combining</em> dimensions and measures helps you to answer specific business questions</strong>. For example, take the two examples above, <em>Page Views</em> (measure) and <em>Item Title </em>(dimension):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you query the database for just <em>Page Views</em>, you'll get a report consisting of a single number: all of the times visitors have viewed pages in your Hub. It's kind of interesting to know this, but it's not very useful.</li>\n<li>If you query the database for just <em>Item Title</em>, you'll get a list of titles of all the Items in your Hub. That could be useful in certain situations, but it doesn't tell you anything about how those Items are performing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, if you create a query that includes <strong>both </strong><em>Page Views </em><strong>and</strong> <em>Item Title</em>, you get something much more helpful: a report that shows how many times each Item in your Hub has been viewed (i.e. <em>Page Views per Item Title</em>). The dimension provides key context to the measure, leading to a new insight.</p>\n<p>This only becomes more powerful as you <strong>combine multiple dimensions and measures</strong> to slice and dice the data in more granular ways. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you also add the dimension <em>Stream Title</em>, you could see if a piece of content performs better in depending on the Stream it's placed in.</li>\n<li>And by further adding the measure <em>Bounce</em> Rate, which measures sessions consisting of just one page view, you can identify Items that appear to be performing well based on total page views, but which but aren't encouraging visitors to check out your other content.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Working with data</h3>\n<p>Specifying the dimensions and measures you want is only half the story, because each one represents <em>all</em> of the available data of that type. In most cases this will actually be <em>too much</em> data to effectively answer specific questions, and you will likely also run into the row limit, where more data is returned than can be displayed.</p>\n<p>As a result, setting appropriate <strong>filters </strong>to selectively exclude data is an important part of generating useful reports. In Explore, you can set filters using most dimensions as well as certain measures. You can also set filters using dimensions/measures that you haven't selected as part of your query: in this case, data from the \"filtering\" dimension/measure won't be displayed in the report itself, but the data that is displayed will still be filtered accordingly. For example, if you filter on <em>Page View Date</em> but have not selected it in your query, then your report will not include a <em>Page View Date </em>column, but will filter the data in the columns that are included based on the <em>Page View</em> <em>Date</em> filter.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>That's everything you need to know to get started! Now that you're familiar with the basics, let's get hands-on and start using Explore.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Access Uberflip Analytics Explore</h2>\n<p>When you're using Uberflip Analytics, you can access Explore at any time. There are <strong>two main ways to open Explore</strong>: from dashboards, and from reports. No matter which method you use, the same Explore interface will appear.</p>\n<h3>Open Explore from a dashboard</h3>\n<p>You can open Explore from any dashboard:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open Uberflip Analytics and view any dashboard.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hover your mouse</strong> over any visualization, and you'll see the <strong>three-dot button</strong> for that visualization appear in its top right corner:<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360076897731/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\" width=\"479\" height=\"243\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Click on the three-dot button</strong> to open the options menu, then click on <strong>Explore From Here</strong> to open Explore:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360076701472/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Open Explore from a report</h3>\n<p>You can also open Explore from any report:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open Uberflip Analytics and view any report.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hover your mouse </strong>anywhere over the report table, and you'll see additional buttons appear in the top right corner:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360076898511/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\" width=\"490\" height=\"217\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Click on the gear button </strong>to open the options menu, then click on <strong>Explore From Here</strong> to open Explore:<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360076702112/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Overview of the Explore interface</h2>\n<p>Whenever you open Explore, it'll look something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079129832/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<p>This is the Explore interface. It's divided into four main areas, which are highlighted in the screenshot above:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Field picker</strong>: The sidebar on the left is the field picker. It lists all of the available fields (dimensions and measures) in the Uberflip Analytics data model, divided into the three main data categories. This is where you find and add dimensions and measures to add to your query, or to use as filters.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data section</strong>: The section near the bottom contains the data table. Dimensions and measures that you have added to your query are displayed here as table columns.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Visualization section</strong>: The section in the middle shows a visualization (such as a chart or diagram) of the data resulting from your query. A default visualization will always be selected automatically based on the data, but you can change this to any other type of visualization that's compatible with the data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Filters section: </strong>The section at the top allows you to manage and configure your filters. It is collapsed by default, and you can click on it to expand it and view or modify current filters. Note also that you add filters to this section using the field picker, and that the field picker also shows a <em>Filter</em> label next to any dimension/measure that is currently being used as a filter.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, let's look at how you can use this interface to create custom reports.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Create a new custom report</h2>\n<p>This section will walk you through the process of creating your first custom report in Explore from start to finish. Over the next few steps, you'll <strong>build an example report</strong> that shows how your content is performing based on two performance indicators, page views and bounce rate. You'll then filter the report to narrow it down to only content that was created and had traffic in the past month.</p>\n<h3>Starting from scratch</h3>\n<p>When you open Explore, the data, visualization, and filters sections will always be pre-populated based on the dashboard visualization or report you came from. This is useful if you want to start with a particular data set and modify it, for example if you want to add more detail to a stock report.</p>\n<p>However, most of the time you'll probably want to create your own custom reports, and in this case it's simplest to start from a clean slate. Thankfully, it's easy to just clear everything away and <strong>start from scratch at any time</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>With Explore open, <strong>click on the</strong> <strong>gear button </strong>in the top right corner to open the options menu:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079255151/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Remove Fields &amp; Filters</strong>:<strong><br></strong><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079130192/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>All previously set dimensions, measures, and filters will be removed, allowing you to start from scratch:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079130292/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now that you have a blank canvas to work with, you can get started building your report.</p>\n<h3>Adding (and removing) dimensions and measures</h3>\n<p>Whenever you build a custom report from scratch, the first step is always to <strong>add dimensions and measures</strong> to your query using the <strong>field picker</strong>. For this example report, you'll add one dimension (<em>Item Title</em>), and two measures (<em>Page Views</em> and <em>Bounce Rate</em>):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Look at the field picker on the left side: it contains a <strong>list of all dimensions and measures</strong> in the data model, as well as a <strong>search box</strong> to narrow down that list.</li>\n<li>The first dimension to add is <strong>Item Title</strong><em>. </em>Type \"item title\" into the search box, and a search results box will appear to show matching dimensions and measures:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079255531/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>In the search results, <strong>click on <em>Item Title</em></strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079255631/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n<ul>\n<li>Alternatively, you can also search through the full list of dimensions and measures to find <em>Item Title</em> under <em>Content &gt;</em> <em>Item</em>, then click on<em> Title</em>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079130912/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Notice how \"Content Item Title\" now appears in the data section of Explore:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360077014872/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Now, repeat this process to add the measure <strong>Page Views</strong>:<strong><br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079256051/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\"><br></strong>\n</li>\n<li>Notice how measures look orange in the field picker (compared to blue-grey for dimensions), and how this is also reflected in the data section:<br><strong><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079256071/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\"></strong>\n</li>\n<li>Repeat the process one more time to add another measure, <strong>Bounce Rate</strong>. Your data section should now look like this:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360077015232/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>You can also <strong>remove any dimension or measure</strong> you've added at any time. To do that, just <strong>hover your mouse over it</strong> in the data section, and a gear button will appear:<img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360077307731/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Click on the gear</strong> <strong>button </strong>to open an options menu, then click on <strong>Remove</strong>: <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360077116752/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The selected dimension/measure will be removed from the data section. If you removed one of the three dimensions/measures you added in the previous steps, don't forget to add it back to your query!</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>If you want to learn more about a particular dimension or measure, you can read a brief description by hovering your mouse over it in the field picket, then clicking the little <em>i</em> tooltip beside it:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079131172/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>In addition, you can also refer to the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008893132-Data-dictionary\">Uberflip Analytics data dictionary</a> for more in-depth definitions of all of the dimensions and measures in the data model.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Before you run this query, there's just one more step: adding some filters to narrow down the data.</p>\n<h3>Setting Filters</h3>\n<p>Right now, the query you've put together includes <strong>all</strong> <strong>data for the selected dimension and measures</strong>, i.e. for all time. For this report you only want data for the last month, so the next step is to <strong>set filters</strong> to narrow down the data being pulled from the database.</p>\n<p>Note that you <em>could</em> press the Run button right now to just pull in all data (in fact, you could do this at any time), but <strong>setting filters first will mean that your query loads faster</strong>, because Explore doesn't have to waste time pulling data you're not interested in.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, narrow down the data to only content that had a page view in the past month. In the <strong>field picker </strong>on the left, search for \"page view date\". In the search results, find <em>Page View Date</em><em>:<br></em><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079131312/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Remember that clicking on a dimension or measure will add it to the data section. Instead, <strong>hover your mouse over <em>Page View Date</em></strong>, and some buttons will appear immediately to the right. <strong>Click on the</strong> <strong>Filter</strong> <strong>button</strong> (three horizontal lines arranged like a pyramid):<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079131432/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\"><br>\n<ul>\n<li>As with adding fields to the data section, you can also do this from the list in the field picker directly. Simply find the dimension or measure to use as a filter, <strong>hover your mouse over it</strong>, and <strong>click on the the same</strong> <strong>Filter</strong> <strong>button</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079256551/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>filter</strong> <strong>section</strong> at the top will automatically expand and display the new filter:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360077230292/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Use the controls in the filter section to <strong>change the filter settings</strong> to \"<em>is in the past 1 complete months</em>\":<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360077230632/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Next, <strong>add another filter</strong> for <em>Item Created Date &gt; Date</em>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079256711/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Configure this filter as \"<em>is in the past 1 complete months</em>\" as well:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360077245872/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>You won't be using this feature for this report, but you can also further refine any filter by adding conditions. To do so, simply <strong>click </strong><strong>on the + button</strong> on the right of the filter. This will add further configurable lines to the filter with either an <strong>AND</strong> or an <strong>OR</strong> condition, set automatically based on the filter option you select:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079258591/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>You can learn more about how to use filters in <a href=\"https://docs.looker.com/exploring-data/filtering-and-limiting\">this article from Looker</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Now your query is all ready to go: all that's left to do is to <strong>run it and pull in some data</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Running a query</h3>\n<p>If you've set everything up according to the instructions above, Explore should now look like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079256951/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>Note also that you can click on the \"In Use\" tab in the field picker to see an overview of the fields you've added both to your query and as filters:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079132192/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>With your dimensions and measures added and filters set, you're ready to run the query and generate a report.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To run your query, simply <strong>click on the <em>Run</em> button </strong>in the top right corner:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079132312/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>You'll see <em>Loading Data... </em>for a few moments while the query runs and Explore pulls in data. When the process is complete, the data table will populate, and a visualization will appear.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360079257251/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notice how the colored bars representing the dimensions and measures in the <strong>data section</strong> are actually <strong>table headings</strong>: now that the data has been populated, the relevant data for each heading appears in rows below. You can <strong>click on a table heading to sort the table</strong>, and drag the table headings to reorder them.</p>\n<p>The <strong>visualization section</strong> will display an auto-selected visualization for the data in the table, based on the type of data. You can toggle between different visualizations using the buttons in the menu bar:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360077441391/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>Now, just start digging into the data to see what you can learn. In addition to examining the data in front of you, you can also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Add or remove dimensions and measures</strong> to change the data that's displayed</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Set, remove or modify</strong><strong> filters </strong>to further refine your query</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Visualize the data</strong> in various ways</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Re-run the query at any time</strong> to grab fresh data or to apply data or filter changes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this is just a one-off query, you can simply exit Explore by navigating away from the page when you're done, and the report will disappear. But if you want, you can also <strong>save</strong> <strong>reports </strong>so that you can return to (and run) them again later.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Save, view, and edit custom reports</h2>\n<h3>Save custom reports</h3>\n<p>Explore has the ability to <strong>save your custom reports</strong> so that you can pull them up again (with refreshed data, if applicable) at any time.

Why? </p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>There are two potential causes for this issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Cause 1: You have selected a single Stream as the source for the content to be displayed in the recommendation panel, but that Stream doesn't contain any items.</strong></p>\n<p>If you've selected a single stream as the source and it doesn't contain any items, there aren't any items that can be displayed within the recommendation panel. Content Recommendations will not display an empty recommendation panel, so the panel simply doesn't appear. Check that the recommendation source Stream has items in it: if not, adding items will ensure that the recommendation panel appears as intended.</p>\n<p><strong>Cause 2: </strong><strong>There is not enough room to display the recommendation panel.</strong></p>\n<p>Due to Uberflip's responsive design, the recommendation panel will not appear on the left side of the screen if there is not enough space. This can happen if the screen resolution (or just the browser window itself) is too small, or if you've changed the zoom level of the browser window.</p>\n<p>This occurs especially when there are additional elements on-screen that reduce the available space, such as a <em>Show Beside </em>CTA. In this case, there sometimes isn't enough real estate on the screen for the recommendation panel, the body content of your item, and the <em>Show Beside</em> CTA to all be displayed at the same time. Whenever this happens, your Hub automatically uses the <em>Most Recent Articles</em> carousel at the bottom of your items to show recommended items that would otherwise appear in the recommendation panel.</p>"

For example, if a visitor's Query String data indicates that their industry is <em>Financial Services</em>, then the Stream will be filtered to show Items that you have tagged as relating to the financial services industry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order for this functionality to work, you must set up Query String <strong>Attribute</strong> <strong>Tags</strong> in your Uberflip account, and add them to all Items in Streams where Query String Personalizer is active. See <a href=\"#h_01FH9GGPB27GQDFTV3ZGY8C1GD\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Using Attribute Tags</a> for more information.</li>\n<li>When <em>Filter Items by Tags</em> is enabled, an Item must have at least one Attribute Tag matching <em>any </em>attribute in the visitor's query string data to be displayed. Items that do not have at least one matching Attribute Tag (or which have no Attribute Tags) will not be displayed.</li>\n<li>If an Item has multiple Attribute Tags, only one of these tags needs to match the visitor's data for that Item to be displayed.</li>\n<li>By default, the minimum number of matching Items that will be displayed is one. If no Items in a Stream have Attribute Tags that match the visitor's query string data, <strong>all</strong> Items in the Stream will be shown (to avoid showing the visitor an empty Stream).<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Using the <a href=\"#h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Show Always Tag</a> changes this behavior. If you use the Show Always Tag, then only Items that have the Show Always Tag will be displayed in this situation (rather than all Items in the Stream).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When a Stream is filtered, the order in which the Items are shown will still be the same as in the original (unfiltered) Stream, except with the filtered Items hidden. For example, if five Items in a Stream are in the order 1-2-3-4-5 and Items 1 and 4 are filtered out, the Stream will still display the remaining Items in the order 2-3-5.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>If you want to use <em>Filter Items by Tags</em>, it's not necessary to tag all the Items in your Hub! To get started, try tagging just the Items in the Streams where this app is enabled.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h_01FH9GGPB27GQDFTV3ZGY8C1GD\">Using Attribute Tags</h4>\n<p>To use the <strong><a href=\"#h_01FH95ZQRMZVX0F46Q0CHWJ25D\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Filter Items by Tags</a></strong> functionality, you must add <strong>Attribute Tags</strong> to all Items that appear in Streams where Query String Personalizer is enabled. Attribute Tags are specially-formatted tags which you use to indicate to Query String Personalizer which content Items should be displayed if a visitor has a given attribute in their query string data.</p>\n<p>To apply an Attribute Tag to an Item, simply add it to the Item in the same way as a normal Item Tag (see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\">Use Tags on your Items</a> for instructions)<a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\" target=\"_self\">.</a> Attribute Tags use the following structure:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">querystring.[field].[value]</code></p>\n<p>Within this basic format, replace <code class=\"no-padding\">[field]</code> with the query string parameter, and <code class=\"no-padding\">[value]</code>with the parameter's desired value. For example, the tag <code class=\"no-padding\">querystring.industry.healthcare</code> would indicate that the tagged Item should be displayed if the URL contains the query string <em>?industry=healthcare</em>, and would therefore be applied to Items relevant to that topic.</p>\n<p>Note that field names and values in tag names must match values in query strings <strong>exactly</strong>: any spaces, parentheses, etc. that exist in the query string must also exist in the tag.</p>\n<p>You can choose to always display certain Items, regardless of the visitor's query string data. To do this, use the <strong>Show Always Tag</strong>:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">querystring.show</code></p>\n<p>This tag is created automatically when you install Query String Personalizer. To use it, simply add it to any Items that you want to always be displayed in Streams where Query String Personalizer is active (provided the Item has been added to the Stream). This is useful for content that is relevant to a very wide audience and should be shown to all visitors, as well as to avoid instances where only one or two Items would be shown in the Stream based on Attribute Tags alone.</p>\n<p>If you use the Show Always Tag, keep in mind that the filtered Stream will still respect the Item order set for the full Stream. As a result, we recommend placing Items with the Show Always Tag either at the beginning or end of the Stream (depending on the content).</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>Do not delete the Show Always Tag from your Uberflip account, even if you don't use it on any Items!

These fields are used to specify the query string field names you want to use as placeholders.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you reference a query string field name in a placeholder, but have not specified it in one of these fields, then the placeholder will not work (will not be replaced with a value from the query string).</li>\n<li>To use this setting, use each individual field to specify both the query string field name and a default value to be used in case the field name does not exist in the URL (or lacks a value).</li>\n<li>Field names and their default values must be formatted as JSON objects, i.e. as a key-value pair. Use this format:<code class=\"no-padding\">fieldName:'Default Value'</code>\n</li>\n<li>Define only one field name/value pair per setting text field, for example:<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360047459671/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">The example setting shown above would allow you to use the field names <em>firstName</em>, <em>companyName</em>, <em>industry</em>, <em>usecase</em> and<em> repName</em> as placeholders, and would insert the appropriate value (e.g. <em>You, Your Company</em>, etc.) anywhere that the corresponding placeholder appears <strong>if there is no value present in the URL</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Short Form: Use 'qs' instead of 'querystring'</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> When the <strong>Filter Items by Tags</strong> and/or <strong>Search &amp; Replace </strong>settings are enabled, this setting can be used to enable an alternative (shorter) format for tags and placeholders.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When this setting it turned on, you can use <code class=\"no-padding\">qs</code> instead of <code class=\"no-padding\">querystring</code> in tags and placeholders, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">qs.[field].[value]</code> rather than <code class=\"no-padding\">querystring.[field].[value]</code>.</li>\n<li>Turn this setting on if you are running into character limits in fields where you are entering tags and placeholders for this app.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Log Mode for Marketers</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level | Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> This setting is used to log basic debugging information in the browser console.</p>\n<p>When this setting is turned on, Query String Personalizer will record information about what the app is doing in the browser console, such as what has been filtered and why. In addition, the data the app received from the current visitor's query string will also be shown.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To view these logs that are generated when this setting is enabled, you must open the console in your browser. How you do this will vary based on the browser you use; for instructions on how to open the console in Chrome, see <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console\">this article from Google</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Best practices</h2>\n<p>When using this app, we recommend the following for best results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For Streams and Items that you intend to share on social media, avoid using <em><a href=\"#h_0d3e097e-ae7e-4bbf-8133-3072feb278eb\" target=\"_self\">Search &amp; Replace </a></em>placeholders in the <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> fields. These fields are used to populate the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612952\" target=\"_self\">Open Graph and Twitter Card tags</a> that social platforms use to generate link previews, and any text you put in them will appear in the preview — including the placeholder text itself, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">{querystring.companyName}</code> instead of the name of the relevant company name.</li>\n<li>For Marketing and Sales Streams, we recommend enabling the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020637332-Personalize-a-Marketing-or-Sales-Stream\"><strong>Banner+Logo template</strong></a> under the Stream's <em>Appearance</em> tab, as this will allow you to use the <a href=\"#h_2118c57d-3adc-48d0-b30b-eb655e3561e8\" target=\"_self\"><em>Swap Logo</em></a> setting. If you select this template, you should also enable the <strong>Hide Stream Title</strong> option and specify a <strong>Banner Title</strong> (also under the <em>Appearance</em> tab). There are two benefits to doing this:\n<ul>\n<li>If the <a href=\"#h_aa8706a5-471c-4b0c-9913-f6ebfa2a7377\" target=\"_self\"><em>Remove Logos When No Match Found</em></a> option is turned on and no logo matches are found, the Banner Title will be shown on the banner instead (rather than an empty banner image).</li>\n<li>If you intend to share the Stream on social media, you can put a placeholder in the Banner Title field (as this isn't shown in the social media preview), but not in the regular Stream Title field (which is shown on social media). In other words, this allows you to personalize the title that a visitor to the Stream sees, without the placeholder text appearing when the same Stream is shared on a social media platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For all Streams and Items that you don't plan to share on social media, but which you expect to be indexed by Google, we recommend using the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612892\" target=\"_self\"><strong>SEO Title and SEO Description fields</strong></a>. These allow you to specify alternative titles and descriptions for your Streams and Items when they appear on Google search result pages. You can use these fields to ensure that any placeholders you put in a Stream's or Item's title/description do not appear when that Stream or Item appears on Google.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>If you experience problems with this app's functionality, this may be due to corrupted data. To resolve the issue, try clearing your browser's cache (or try using the app in Incognito Mode to see if that resolves the issue).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>For developers</h2>\n<p>Because this app manipulates a large portion of Stream and Item pages, a race condition can occur, which can cause other JavaScript <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_self\">custom code</a> running on the same page to malfunction. </p>\n<p>If your JS code performs other manipulations on pages where this app is active, you should ensure it runs <strong>after</strong> the app to avoid problems. To help you do this, a <strong>callback functio</strong><strong>n </strong>is built into the app that will be called once the app has finished executing its own code.</p>\n<p>To leverage the callback function, create a function named <code class=\"no-padding\">ufPersonalizerCallback</code> in your own custom code and place your JS inside it. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;<br>var ufPersonalizerCallback = function(){<br> /** Your JS **/<br>};<br>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>"

Doing so confirms your ownership of the site, and adds a Pinterest <em>Pin it</em> button that appears when visitors mouse over your image content:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360045138192/Hubs___Edit_Article_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Edit_Article_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"419\" height=\"176\"></p>\n<p>Visitors can use this button to save your content to their Pinterest accounts, and you will get access to website analytics in Pinterest around the use of this button on your Hub.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>Don't want the <em>Pin it</em> button to appear on your Hub?

If you use a personal account, this can cause issues if that account becomes deactivated or inaccessible (i.e. if the owner leaves your organization).</p>\n<p>Not also that any web property can only be associated with a single Pinterest account. Once your Hub has been claimed by a Pinterest account, it must be released by that account before it can be claimed by another account.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_a14dab7a-b140-434f-9df9-435ecd483b6d\">Step 1: Get the HTML Tag From Pinterest</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>To get started, <strong>go to this article</strong> from Pinterest:\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/claim-your-website\" target=\"_self\">Pinterest: Claim your website</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Follow the instructions under the heading <strong>\"Add a meta tag to your website\"</strong>.</li>\n<li>When you reach <strong>Step 4</strong>: Type in <strong>your Hub's URL:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360045265071/_91__Pinterest.png\" alt=\"_91__Pinterest.png\" width=\"501\" height=\"132\"></strong>\n</li>\n<li>When you reach <strong>Step 6:</strong> Copy<strong> only the code that appears next to</strong> <code class=\"no-padding\">content=</code> (don't copy the quotation marks):<br> <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360045244151/_91__Pinterest.png\" alt=\"_91__Pinterest.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Once you have copied the code from the HTML tag, <strong>open a new browser tab or window </strong>but <strong>keep the Pinterest window open</strong> (as you'll be returning to it later).

For example, instead of <code class=\"no-padding\">https://www.mycompany.com</code>, I just want <code class=\"no-padding\">https://mycompany.com</code>. Is that possible?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>Yes, you can exclude \"www\" from your Hub's <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018876192\" target=\"_self\">custom domain</a> URL. There are three possible scenarios:</p>\n<h3>Scenario 1: Subdomain Custom Domain</h3>\n<p>If you choose a custom domain that is a <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018786372\" target=\"_self\">subdomain</a> of your main website, for example <code class=\"no-padding\">https://<strong>resources</strong>.mycompany.com</code>, then the subdomain (in this case <code class=\"no-padding\">resources</code>) will simply replace \"www\" in the URL.</p>\n<h3>Scenario 2: Subdirectory Custom Domain</h3>\n<p>If you go with a custom domain that is a <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018964792\" target=\"_self\">subdirectory</a> of your main website, and the website's URL already does not include the \"www\", then that would apply to the custom domain as well. For example, if your Hub will live in the subdirectory <code class=\"no-padding\">resources</code> on your website at <code class=\"no-padding\">https://mycompany.com</code>, then the full URL for your Hub would simply be <code class=\"no-padding\">https://mycompany.com/<strong>resources</strong></code>.</p>\n<h3>Scenario 3: Standalone Custom Domain</h3>\n<p>Things get a little tricky if you want your Hub to function more like a standalone website, and live on a custom domain that is not associated with your existing website: for example, if your main website lives at <code class=\"no-padding\">https://mycompany.com</code>, and you want your Hub to be on a URL like <code class=\"no-padding\">https://mycompanyresources.com</code>.</p>\n<p>Although this kind of standalone custom domain does not include a subdomain (as www is technically a subdomain), you would still set it up the same way as a subdomain custom domain in practice. This presents two challenges:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Uberflip's <em>Add A Domain</em> tool will only allow you to add domains in the format <em>a.b.c</em>, i.e. they must include a subdomain.</li>\n<li>The process for setting up a subdomain custom domain requires creating a CNAME record with your DNS provider. However, for technical reasons, most DNS providers will not allow you to create a CNAME record with a bare domain (e.g. a domain that lacks any subdomain element, including \"www\"). </li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a result, please <strong>contact your Customer Success Manager or Uberflip Support</strong> if you want to use a standalone custom domain without \"www\", as they will need to help you to set it up.</p>"

This allows the visitor to interact with the Item for anywhere from 5 to 90 seconds before being blocked by the CTA. In general, we recommend that you do <strong>not</strong> set a delay. If you want to enable this option, you can <strong>use the dropdown</strong> to select the desired delay duration:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018284852/Fullscreen_2019-01-03__12_50_PM.png\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-01-03__12_50_PM.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Enabling the <strong>Allow dismissal</strong> option allows visitors to \"open the gate\" by simply closing the Form CTA rather than submitting their details. In most cases, we recommend that you leave this option <strong>disabled</strong>. If you want to turn it on, check the box next to it:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018285172/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Show Item body </strong>option is used for Items where the main content (such as an ebook or video) is accompanied by some additional body text. Enabling this option will gate only the main content behind the CTA, while the body text will be visible, like this: <br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018155611/The_Content_Experience_Report___Uberflip.png\" alt=\"The_Content_Experience_Report___Uberflip.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"422\"><br>This is useful for giving visitors some context and information about the gated content, which can help entice them to access it (by submitting the Form CTA).

            "body": "<hr>\n<p>Learn how to optimize your existing blog's RSS feed to avoid common problems when pulling blog content into your Hub.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Before You Begin</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To complete most of the steps described in this article, you'll need the necessary access to change settings in your blogging platform.</li>\n<li>Before making any changes to your blog's RSS feed settings, make sure to check whether these changes will impact any other software tools or activities that depend on the RSS feed.</li>\n<li>These optimizations won't work retroactively on existing Blog Streams in your Hub. If you previously imported a blog via RSS and it's experiencing the issues that the optimization steps address, you will need to delete that Blog Stream and re-import it afterwards.</li>\n<li>This article outlines general optimization steps that you should be able to apply to any blog platform. Please refer to your blogging platform's documentation for specific instructions on how to configure its RSS feed. For example, here are the relevant help articles for <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/support/settings/reading-settings/\">WordPress</a> and <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/cos-blog/set-up-your-blog-subscription-features-in-hubspot\">HubSpot</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Optimization Guidelines</h2>\n<p>Regardless of the specific blogging platform that you use, you should make sure you have configured your RSS feed in the following ways:</p>\n<h3>Increase the Number of Posts</h3>\n<p><strong>Why do this? </strong>For most RSS feeds, the number of posts included in the feed is fairly low: usually the latest 10 to 25. If you don't change this number, that number is the maximum that will be pulled into your Blog Stream in Uberflip, even if you have many more posts.</p>\n<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Since you generally want to pull all existing posts in the blog into your Hub, you want to make this number as high as possible — at least the same as the total number of posts in the blog. Once the import has been completed, you can reduce it back to whatever number you prefer. If you are unable to raise the number of posts in the RSS feed high enough due to limitations on your blogging platform, please <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\">contact us for help.</a></p>\n<p>Keep in mind that, on an initial import, the maximum number of posts that you can pull in to Uberflip is <strong>200</strong>. If the blog you want to import via RSS has more than 200 posts, please <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\">contact us</a>, as we can lift this limit to import all of the posts. In this case, you must still set the number of posts in your blog's RSS feed as high as possible, as we will still be limited by this number after lifting the 200 post cap.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Include Full Posts</h3>\n<p><strong>Why do this?</strong> RSS feeds will often be set up by default to only include excerpts, descriptions, or summaries. If you don't change this setting, you won't be able to pull the full blog posts, including images, into your Hub.</p>\n<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Set up your RSS feed so that the full content of the article is included within the HTML <em>&lt;content:encoded&gt; </em>tag that is present in the RSS version of your article.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Ensure Image Height and Width are Specified</h3>\n<p><strong>Why do this?</strong> Uberflip Blog Streams acquire a blog post's images from the HTML <em>&lt;img&gt;</em> tags present in the RSS version of the post. In order for this to work, the tag must specify the width and height of each image, otherwise the images will not be pulled in with the post.</p>\n<p><strong>What to do: </strong>Make sure that the <em>&lt;img&gt; </em>tags in your RSS feed are configured to look something like this:</p>\n<pre>&lt;img src=”IMAGE URL” alt=”IMAGE DESCRIPTION” <strong>height=”650″ width=”200″</strong>&gt;</pre>\n<p>If you use \"featured images\" for your posts (these could be used on the summary page of all of your articles as a thumbnail, or above the article), you should ensure that these images are also included in the RSS feed.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can also see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020840711\">this article</a> to learn more about ensuring your images are properly formatted in your RSS feed.</p>"

The ability to access and use Embed Parameters is controlled by specific permissions, which you can optionally grant to other users or user groups as needed. See <a href=\"#h_01F778GWT569DT8AG2G74FM9ZW\" target=\"_self\">the reference table below</a> for details.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About Embed Parameters</h2>\n<p>As a savvy digital marketer, you're probably already using <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-using-utm-parameters/\">UTM parameters</a> to understand where direct traffic to your Uberflip Hub is coming from. UTM parameters (or, more generically, URL parameters) are the industry standard for tracking and attributing traffic from direct links, and are widely supported across marketing tools.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you'd use URL parameters anytime you share a link to your Hub content. But when you're dealing with embed codes (rather than plain link URLs), this can be tricky to do — especially when it comes to links that you don't control, such as those that your Sales team is sharing through the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020177492-Share-Hub-content-with-the-Uberflip-extensions\" target=\"_self\">Uberflip Extensions</a> or <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057767632-Sales-Assist-User-Guide-for-Admins\">Sales Assist</a>.</p>\n<p>This is where the <strong>Embed Parameters</strong> feature can help. With Embed Parameters, you can configure URL parameters (including both UTM and fully custom parameters) that will be automatically added to the link URL whenever embedded content is shared from your Hub.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01F7VEPPE8KRJ6NZ17JYETBBZK\">How it works</h3>\n<p>Uberflip embeds are essentially links to your Hub content that are styled like Hub tiles, and which you can place (\"embed\") in various non-Hub settings like other websites, emails, etc. By default, these embeds do not include URL parameters, and it's difficult for users to add them manually. But with Embed Parameters, you can <strong>set up URL parameters and predefined values</strong>, and these will <strong>automatically be added to all embeds</strong> generated by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023119772\">Embed Item Tile</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.uberflip.com/details/sales-assist-1/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Sales Assist</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, say you use Embed Parameters to set up the parameter <em>utm_medium</em>, and then predefine the value <em>uf-embed</em> for this parameter. As a result, embed links generated in that Hub will automatically include that UTM parameter and value, resulting in a URL that looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360095669972/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<p>Since you know this UTM parameter indicates a link shared via an embed, you can now use it to attribute direct traffic to embeds whenever the parameter is present.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">\n<em>Embed Parameters </em>and other types of Hub embeds</h4>\n<p>Embed Parameters works with embeds generated by <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023119772-Embed-Individual-Content-Tiles-into-Websites-and-Email-Campaigns\">Embed Item Tile</a> and <a href=\"https://marketplace.uberflip.com/details/sales-assist-1/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Sales Assist</a>.</p>\n<p>Your Hub also has two other embed types: <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023374631-Embed-a-Stream-Into-Your-Website\">Embed Stream Tiles</a>, and <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020859752\">Embed CTA</a>. However, due to the way they work, Embed Parameters does <strong>not</strong> work with embeds generated using these tools.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Custom URL parameters and dynamic values</h3>\n<p>While you <em>can</em> use UTM parameters with Embed Parameters, you're not limited to them: you can also <strong>freely define your own custom parameters</strong>. This means that, in addition to the five standard UTM parameters (<em>medium</em>, <em>source</em>, <em>campaign</em>, <em>content</em>, and <em>term</em>), you can also create any parameter of your choice for use cases beyond those that UTM parameters are designed for.</p>\n<p>Embed Parameters also allows you to set <strong>dynamic values</strong>: instead of specifying a static value for a parameter, you can also choose to insert one or more <strong>variables</strong> from a preset list. When you use a variable, Embed Parameters will dynamically insert the corresponding value each time an embed is generated: for example, you could create a parameter like <em>repname</em>, then use the <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User First Name</span> </em>and<em> User Last Name</em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">variables </span>to dynamically insert the name of the specific Sales rep who created and shared the embed:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360095602791/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<p>This makes it easy to attribute direct traffic to the specific individual who shared the link. For more information about the available variables, see <a href=\"#h_01F7PX02W6P1C33X5PC6FW95K9\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Dynamic values</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Add new Embed Parameters</h2>\n<p>You can create as many Embed Parameters as you like.

As long as the visitor has been profiled in your MAP, Sales Assist will incorporate identifying information from their MAP profile into the notification:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360092089512/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\" width=\"337\" height=\"132\"></p>\n<p>If the <strong>visitor's email is known</strong>, but not their name, that email will be shown in the notification.</p>\n<p>In addition to MAP-enriched notifications (or as an alternative option), you can also configure a <strong>backup enrichment source</strong>.

            "body": "<h2>Objective</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to remove internal traffic from your Uberflip Analytics data is to <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039250291\" target=\"_self\">exclude your office IP addresses</a>. However, this doesn't cover remote employees, and excluding their individual IP addresses is usually ineffective because most home internet connections use dynamic IP addresses, which change periodically.</p>\n<p>A better solution for excluding remote internal users is to use their <strong>Visitor IDs</strong> instead. Uberflip Analytics assigns unique Visitor IDs to all visitors to your Hub, so in this article, we'll show you how to identify the Visitor IDs of your internal users, then set up persistent filters that automatically exclude these Visitor IDs across all dashboards.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_f4a19d58-546f-4d83-b663-3e443dd6d15c\">Setup: Enable the <em>Save Dashboard Filters </em>Setting</h2>\n<p>Since you'll be using a dashboard filter to exclude internal Visitor IDs, we strongly recommend that you <strong>turn on the <em>Save Dashboard Filters</em> setting</strong>. When this setting is enabled, any filter you set on one dashboard will be saved and automatically applied to all other dashboards. This ensures that you only need to set up the filter to exclude internal Visitor IDs once, rather than each time you open a dashboard.</p>\n<p>You can find detailed instructions on how to enable the <em>Save Dashboard Filters</em> setting <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040312352\" target=\"_self\">in this article</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 1: Identify an Internal-Only Hub Page</h2>\n<p>Before you can filter based on Visitor IDs, you need to determine which Visitor IDs belong to your internal users. To do that, you can leverage Uberflip Analytics itself: for any page in a Hub, Uberflip Analytics can export a list of Visitor IDs that viewed that page. Therefore, all you need is a Hub page that is not accessible outside your organization, since any Visitor ID that viewed it would by definition belong to an internal user.</p>\n<p>As a result, you first need to <strong>identify a suitable Hub page</strong>, or <strong>create one</strong> if necessary. This page:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Can be <strong>any type of page within a Hub</strong>: a Hub homepage, a Stream page, or an Item page.</li>\n<li>Must be <strong>accessible only to internal users</strong>.

This means the page can't be in a Hub where the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040761132\"><em>Prevent Analytics Collection</em> option</a> is enabled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your main objective is to capture as many internal Visitor IDs as possible, so the page you choose <strong>should have been viewed by most (or ideally all) of your internal users</strong>. The ideal situation is if you have an internal-only Hub, as this will allow you to collect the Visitor IDs of everyone who viewed <em>any</em> page in that Hub. Regardless of the type of page you choose, we recommend specifically instructing all of your internal users to visit the page to ensure their Visitor IDs are captured.</p>\n<p>When you have identified (or created) the necessary Hub page, proceed to the next step.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 2: Export a List of Internal Visitor IDs</h2>\n<p>Using the internal-only Hub page you you identified or set up earlier, you can now get a list of internal Visitor IDs from Uberflip Analytics.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip and <strong>go to Uberflip Analytics</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <em>Visitors &gt; Session Overview</em> to open the <strong>Session Overview dashboard</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Filters</strong> at the top of the dashboard to expand the filters menu.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Set a filter</strong> to display<strong> just the internal-only Hub page</strong> you selected:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>For a Hub:</strong> Use <em>Hub </em>| <em>is equal to </em>|<em> [insert name of Hub]</em>. This filter will include visitors to all pages in the selected Hub, and is the best option if you have an internal-only Hub.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For a Stream:</strong> Use <em>Stream Title </em>|<em> is equal to </em>|<em> [insert name of Stream]. </em>This filter will include visitors to the Stream page itself, and any Items in the Stream (even if they did not visit the Stream page).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For an Item: </strong>Use <em>Item Title </em>|<em> is equal to </em>|<em> [insert name of Item]. </em>This filter will include only visitors to the specified Item page.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If needed, <strong>change the <em>View Date</em> filter</strong> to a longer time range to ensure as many Visitor IDs as possible can be captured.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Click on</strong> <strong>Run</strong> to apply the filter.</li>\n<li>In the dashboard, scroll down to the <strong>Session Details</strong> table at the bottom, which displays sessions broken down by Visitor ID (second column from left).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hover your mouse over the table</strong>, then <strong>click on the three-dot (\"meatball\") menu button</strong> that appears in the top right of the table (in the \"Session Details\" title bar).</li>\n<li>In the menu that appears, click on <strong>Download Data</strong>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Download</strong> window will appear. In this window, <strong>change the <em>Limit</em> setting to <em>Custom...</em></strong>, which will automatically default to a setting of 5000 rows:<br> <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360055523152/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n<ul>\n<li>We recommend leaving all other options on their default settings.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Click on Download</strong>. This will export a CSV file that contains all of the Visitor IDs that have viewed the selected Hub page. After a few moments, <strong>the download should begin automatically</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When the download has finished, proceed to the next step.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 3: Set Up a Filter to Exclude Internal Visitor IDs</h2>\n<p>With the list of internal Visitor IDs, you can now set up a filter to exclude data associated with those Visitor IDs from your dashboards.</p>\n<p>Dashboard filters<strong> only apply for the user who set them</strong>, so any other Uberflip Analytics users in your organization will need <strong>set up their own filters </strong>by following these instructions. However, all users can use the same list of Visitor IDs, so the person who exports the list can simply share it with others so that they don't need to export it themselves.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>If you turned on <em>Save Dashboard Filters</em> as <a href=\"#h_f4a19d58-546f-4d83-b663-3e443dd6d15c\" target=\"_self\">recommended above</a>, you'll only have to do this once.

If the setting is off, you'll need to complete these steps every time you open any dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Filters</strong> at the top of the dashboard to expand the filters menu.</li>\n<li>Scroll down to the <strong>Visitor ID filter</strong>.</li>\n<li>Set the filter condition to <strong>is not equal to</strong> and <strong>paste in the Visitor IDs</strong> that you copied from the CSV file:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360055617852/Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Click on Run</strong> to apply the filter. Any data associated with the listed Visitor IDs will be excluded from all metrics shown on your dashboards.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>Once you've exported the CSV file and copied out the internal Visitor IDs, simply paste them into a TXT file (e.g. with Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac) to easily share them with any other users who need to set up the filter. </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Additional Notes</h2>\n<p>Uberflip Analytics will assign a new Visitor ID to any visitor who is not yet known (does not yet have an Uberflip Analytics cookie). This means that internal visitors will be assigned new Visitor IDs if they clear their browser cache/cookies, use incognito mode, or use a different browser. As a result, you may need to collect a fresh list of internal Visitor IDs and update your filter from time to time.</p>"

Attribute Tags are specially-formatted tags which you use to indicate to Demandbase Personalizer which content Items should be displayed if a visitor has a given attribute in their Demandbase data.</p>\n<p>To apply an Attribute Tag to an Item, simply add it to the Item in the same way as a normal Item Tag (see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\">Use Tags on your Items</a> for instructions)<a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\" target=\"_self\">.</a> Attribute Tags use the following structure:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">demandbase.[attribute].[value]</code></p>\n<p>Within this basic format, replace <code class=\"no-padding\">[attribute]</code> with the Demandbase attribute, and <code class=\"no-padding\">[value]</code>with the attribute’s desired value. For example, the tag <code class=\"no-padding\">demandbase.audience.SMB</code> would indicate that the tagged Item should be displayed if a visitor’s audience attribute is \"<em>SMB</em>\", and would therefore be applied to Items relevant to that topic.</p>\n<p>Note that values in tag names must match Demandbase values <strong>exactly</strong>: any spaces, parentheses, etc. that exist in the Demandbase value must also exist in the tag. See <a href=\"#h_4bf79527-0059-4528-9195-ec425bbca904\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Available Demandbase Attributes</strong></a> below for a list of Demandbase attributes and example values.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\">Using the Show Always Tag</h4>\n<p>You can choose to always display certain Items, regardless of the visitor's Demandbase data. To do this, use the <strong>Show Always Tag</strong>:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">demandbase.show</code></p>\n<p>This tag is created automatically when you install Demandbase Personalizer. To use it, simply add it to any Items that you want to always be displayed in Streams where Demandbase Personalizer is active (provided the Item has been added to the Stream). This is useful for content that is relevant to a very wide audience and should be shown to all visitors, as well as to avoid instances where only one or two Items would be shown in the Stream based on Attribute Tags alone.</p>\n<p>If you use the Show Always Tag, keep in mind that the filtered Stream will still respect the Item order set for the full Stream. As a result, we recommend placing Items with the Show Always Tag either at the beginning or end of the Stream (depending on the content).</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>Do not delete the Show Always Tag from your Uberflip account, even if you don't use it on any Items!

These fields are used to populate the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612952\" target=\"_self\">Open Graph and Twitter Card tags</a> that social platforms use to generate link previews, and any text you put in them will appear in the preview — including the placeholder text itself, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">{demandbase.company_name}</code> instead of the relevant company name.</li>\n<li>For Marketing and Sales Streams, we recommend enabling the <strong><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020637332-Personalize-a-Marketing-or-Sales-Stream\">Banner+Logo template</a></strong> under the Stream's <em>Appearance</em> tab, as this will allow you to use the <a href=\"#h_b000deae-dc03-454b-a70d-e6feae3faacb\" target=\"_self\"><em>Swap Logo</em></a> setting. If you select this template, you should also enable the <strong>Hide Stream Title</strong> option and specify a <strong>Banner Title</strong> (also under the <em>Appearance</em> tab). There are two benefits to doing this:\n<ul>\n<li>If the <a href=\"#h_fda0dc92-8776-4a7d-9223-a364f8d1ca02\" target=\"_self\"><em>Remove Logos When No Match Found</em></a> option is turned on and no logo matches are found, the Banner Title will be shown on the banner instead (rather than an empty banner image).</li>\n<li>If you intend to share the Stream on social media, you can put a placeholder in the Banner Title field (as this isn't shown in the social media preview), but not in the regular Stream Title field (which is shown on social media). In other words, this allows you to personalize the title that a visitor to the Stream sees, without the placeholder text appearing when the same Stream is shared on a social media platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For all Streams and Items that you don't plan to share on social media, but which you expect to be indexed by Google, we recommend using the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612892\" target=\"_self\"><strong>SEO Title and SEO Description fields</strong></a>. These allow you to specify alternative titles and descriptions for your Streams and Items when they appear on Google search result pages. You can use these fields to ensure that any placeholders you put in a Stream's or Item's title/description do not appear when that Stream or Item appears on Google.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>If you experience problems with this app's functionality, this may be due to corrupted data. To resolve the issue, try clearing your browser's cache (or try using the app in Incognito Mode to see if that resolves the issue).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>For developers</h2>\n<p>Because this app manipulates a large portion of Stream and Item pages, a race condition can occur, which can cause other JavaScript <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_self\">custom code</a> running on the same page to malfunction. </p>\n<p>If your JS code performs other manipulations on pages where this app is active, you should ensure it runs <strong>after</strong> the app to avoid problems. To help you do this, a <strong>callback functio</strong><strong>n </strong>is built into the app that will be called once the app has finished executing its own code.</p>\n<p>To leverage the callback function, create a function named <code class=\"no-padding\">ufPersonalizerCallback</code> in your own custom code and place your JS inside it. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;<br>var ufPersonalizerCallback = function(){<br> /** Your JS **/<br>};<br>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>"

The following MAPs are supported: <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022063751\" target=\"_self\">Marketo</a>, <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022207231\" target=\"_self\">Oracle Eloqua</a>, <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021942272\" target=\"_self\">Pardot</a>, and <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021562692\" target=\"_self\">HubSpot</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About Content Attribution</h2>\n<p>In Uberflip, you can add Content Attribution to any individual content Item to track when a known visitor has interacted with that Item. This is useful for your prospect nurturing and qualifying process: by setting up Content Attribution on ToFu Items that you associate with high engagement, you can collect data to feed into the lead scoring model in your MAP. This can help you better understand how engaged your prospects are, and when they turn from prospects into qualified leads.</p>\n<p>When you configure an Item with Content Attribution, you specify a field in your MAP, along with a fixed value of your choice. Anytime a known visitor interacts with that Item, Uberflip will write the value you specified to that visitor's MAP profile.</p>\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\n<p>Content Attribution works only for <strong>known visitors</strong>, which are prospects who have previously been profiled in your MAP by submitting a <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020989871\" target=\"_self\">Form CTA</a>. Content Attribution will not work with unknown visitors, and it can't attribute past activity to formerly unknown visitors after they are profiled.</p>\n<p>Content Attribution triggers a MAP update when a known visitor <strong>interacts</strong> with an Item on which the feature has been configured. In this context, \"interacts\" is defined as when the visitor has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Viewed an Item with Content Attribution, <strong>or</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Submitted a Form CTA placed beside an Item with Content Attribution (i.e. they initially viewed the Item as an unknown visitor, and are now known because they submitted the CTA), <strong>or</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Submitted a Form CTA that links to an Item with Content Attribution (via the Link to Content feature on the Form CTA's \"Success\" page)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>It is possible that a visitor submits a CTA placed beside Item A with Content Attribution, and that CTA also links to Item B with Content Attribution: in other words, the visitor has effectively interacted with two separate Items with Content Attribution at the same time. In this situation, <strong>the Item linked from the Form CTA </strong>(i.e. Item B) will be the one that is tracked in the visitor's MAP profile.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_fcc546be-8759-4aac-aeac-519e145b0275\">Identify the MAP Field to Update</h2>\n<p>Before you set up Content Attribution, you need to decide which field in your MAP should be updated when a prospect interacts with the Item (or create that field, if necessary). To do that, you'll first need to think about <em>how</em> you want to use Content Attribution. Keep in mind that Content Attribution will always write a fixed value to a fixed field, defined per-Item. When you select a field, you can choose if you want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <strong>same field</strong> for all Items on which you enable Content Attribution. Depending on your use case, you could specify different values for each Item, or use the same one for all. Note that, unless you configure your MAP to block updates to this field, it will be updated each time the visitors interacts with a different Item with Content Attribution.</li>\n<li>Use <strong>separate, Item-specific fields</strong> for all Items on which you enable Content Attribution. Again depending on use case, you could use the same value for all Items, or different values per-Item (i.e. if you want the field-value combination for each Item to be unique).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have settled on the best scenario for your use case:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your MAP.</li>\n<li>In your MAP, either <strong>find the appropriate field</strong> or <strong>create it.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>See below for MAP-specific instructions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Once you have found or created the field, get its<strong> name</strong>. This is the name that uniquely identifies that particular field, and is sometimes also known as its \"API name\" (or similar).</li>\n<li>Once you have the name(s) of the field(s) you want to use, you're ready to set up Content Attribution.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's how to find the field name in your MAP of choice:</p>\n<div class=\"tabs tabs--colored-1\">\n<div class=\"tabs-menu\">\n<span class=\"tabs-link is-active\">Marketo</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Oracle Eloqua</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Pardot</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">HubSpot</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab\">\n<p>In Marketo, you're looking for the field's <strong>REST API Name</strong>. To get the REST API Name for a given field, you'll need to export a list of fields. For instructions on how to do that, see this article from Marketo:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.marketo.com/display/public/DOCS/Export+a+List+of+All+Marketo+API+Field+Names\">Marketo: Export a List of All Marketo API Field Names</a></p>\n<p>Once you have downloaded the export, open it, then look under the column <strong>Friendly Label</strong> for the field you want to use. When you locate it, look at the corresponding value under the column <strong>REST API Name</strong>: this is the name you will need.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab is-hidden\">\n<p>In Oracle Eloqua, you're looking for the field's <strong>Database name</strong>. You can look up the Database name for any given field in Eloqua by following these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Eloqua.</li>\n<li>Go to <em>Settings &gt; Setup</em>.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Fields &amp; Views</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under the <strong>Fields</strong> tab, use the search box to find the field you want to use.</li>\n<li>Click on the field to view more information about it in the pane on the right.

Instead, simply <strong>scroll down</strong> until you see the field labeled <strong>Internal name</strong>: the value of this field is the field name you'll need.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Enable Content Attribution for an Item</h2>\n<p>You can enable Content Attribution on any Item. Content Attribution settings are Item-specific: the field and value that you specify will be passed only for the particular Item on which you configure them, so you must set up Content Attribution individually for every Item on which you want to use the feature. Content Attribution settings on an Item apply across your Hub, so the configured field/value will be passed regardless of which Stream the Item was when the visitor interacted with it.</p>\n<p>To enable Content Attribution for an Item:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip and navigate to the Hub you want to work with.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Content</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the pane on the right, you should be on the <strong>Streams tab</strong>. Here, find any Stream that contains the Item on which you want to configure Content Attribution and <strong>click on it</strong>.\n<ul>\n<li>You can choose any Stream in which the Item appears, including Marketing Streams. The settings you configure will apply to the Item across all Streams in which it appears.</li>\n<li>You cannot do this from the Items tab — you must access the Item from the Streams view.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>While viewing the Stream, locate the Item you want to work with and hover your mouse over the hamburger menu button in the lower left corner of its Item Tile:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360037440112/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>In the menu that appears, click on <strong>Set Integration Item Parameters</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360037440352/Fullscreen_2019-08-30__10_06_AM.png\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-08-30__10_06_AM.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Modify Hidden Fields for Item</strong> window will appear.

            "body": "<hr>\n<p>Did you know that Uberflip automatically protects traffic to your Hub with HTTPS? Here's why that matters, and how it works.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>HTTP vs. HTTPS: A Quick Primer</h2>\n<p>If you've heard that you should be using <strong>HTTPS</strong> but aren't really sure <strong>what it is or why you need it</strong>, this primer is for you. If you're <strong>already familiar with this topic</strong>, you can <a href=\"#h_3a21c173-0f01-4518-946f-bfd92d9ccb89\" target=\"_self\"><strong>skip ahead</strong></a>.</p>\n<h3>What is HTTPS?</h3>\n<p>You've probably heard of HTTP, the <em>HyperText Transfer Protocol</em>. It's a system that web browsers and web servers use to talk to one another; a way for them to send requests (<em>\"send me this webpage\"</em>) and responses (<em>\"here is the webpage you asked for\"</em>) back and forth.</p>\n<p>Most websites don't use HTTP anymore, because it has a major security flaw: it's <strong>not encrypted</strong>. This means that, with HTTP,  anyone who's listening in can see exactly what's being sent back and forth between a browser and a web server. And it's not just three-letter government agencies who can do this: with HTTP, anyone on the open WiFi network at your local coffee shop could see which websites you're looking at.</p>\n<p>HTTPS fixes this problem. The <em>S</em> stands for <strong>secure</strong>, to indicate that all communications over HTTPS are <strong>encrypted</strong>. Only the two parties talking to each other (the browser and the server) can decrypt and read each other's messages — to any eavesdroppers, the encrypted messages just look like garbled nonsense.</p>\n<h3>Why is using HTTPS important?</h3>\n<p>In the past, only websites dealing with \"sensitive\" information (like banks or ecommerce sites) used HTTPS, and HTTP was considered \"good enough\" for everything else. But HTTP has inherent flaws that make it a huge security risk: for example, HTTP does not verify that you're actually connecting to the website you asked for, so there's little to stop an attacker from impersonating a website and stealing your data.</p>\n<p>In recognition of this problem, there has been a push over the last several years to use HTTPS for <strong>all</strong> kinds of websites. If you take a look at your browser's address bar, you should see something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360044140311/HTTPS_for_Hubs_Explained___Uberflip_Help.png\" alt=\"HTTPS_for_Hubs_Explained___Uberflip_Help.png\"></p>\n<p>This padlock icon indicates that the website you're on uses HTTPS, and you're likely to see it on most websites you visit. In fact, as of 2019, the majority of the world's websites use HTTPS.</p>\n<p>This push towards HTTPS has been driven in large part by internet giants like Google. Starting in 2014, Google decided to <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html\">prioritize websites that use HTTPS in its search results</a>, effectively downranking sites that use HTTP. And since <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html\">July 2018</a>, Chrome has displayed this message to highlight websites that don't use HTTPS:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360028119571/Example_Domain.png\" alt=\"Example_Domain.png\"></p>\n<p>On today's web, using HTTP is detrimental to your traffic, so you should make sure that all your web properties use HTTPS. The good news is, <strong>using HTTPS with an Uberflip Hub couldn't be easier</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_4a3a60d3-5ddc-45e9-85b0-75555bed064d\" class=\"callout__title\">A Quick Note on Terminology</h4>\n<p>You may have also seen the term <strong>SSL</strong> used in the context of HTTPS. This term refers to the <em>encryption technology</em> that HTTPS uses, and is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \"HTTPS\".</p>\n<p>SSL has actually been replaced by the more-secure <strong>TLS</strong> technology — but although it's technically incorrect, the term \"SSL\" is still widely used. Whenever you see the term \"SSL\" (including in Uberflip's documentation), you can generally assume that this refers to more-secure TLS technology.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_3a21c173-0f01-4518-946f-bfd92d9ccb89\">How does HTTPS work on Uberflip Hubs?</h2>\n<p>If you have set up HTTPS for another website in the past, you already know that it can be a hassle: you have to buy an SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), install the certificate on your web server (or, more often, wait for your IT team to do it), and then do it all over again every time the certificate expires.</p>\n<p>You don't need to worry about any of this with your Uberflip Hub. Uberflip <strong>automatically obtains and sets up the SSL certificate</strong> for your Hub's domain, and <strong>automatically renews it when it expires</strong>. This means that you get all the benefits of HTTPS on your Hub, without the hassle of setting it up and maintaining it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Where does Uberflip get the SSL certificate for my Hub?</h2>\n<p>To set up HTTPS for Hubs, we use certificates from <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\"><strong>Let's Encrypt</strong></a>. Let's Encrypt is a new kind of Certificate Authority run by the <a href=\"https://www.abetterinternet.org/\">Internet Security Research Group</a>, a public-benefit corporation backed by a number of major organizations, including Mozilla, Cisco, Shopify, the Ford Foundation, and the EFF. Their mission is to encourage the wider use of HTTPS by making the entire setup and maintenance process much easier. To that end, Let's Encrypt certificates are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Free</strong>: Unlike traditional CAs, Let's Encrypt provides and validates certificates at no cost</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Automated</strong>: The entire enrollment process for certificates is automated, as is renewal of the certificate upon expiration</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Open: </strong>Let's Encrypt uses open standards, and their code is open source</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Simple</strong>: With Let's Encrypt certificates, you don't need to worry about payment, installation, or keeping track of expiring certificates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although they're free, Let's Encrypt certificates are <strong>just as secure</strong> as certificates from traditional CAs. And because they're automated, Uberflip can take care of provisioning, setting up and renewing your Let's Encrypt certificates for your Hub domains — you don't need to do a thing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How do I set up HTTPS for my Hub?</h2>\n<h3>New Hubs</h3>\n<p>Whenever you add a new domain to your Hub (under <strong>Hub Options &gt; Change Domain &gt; Add a Domain</strong>), it will be automatically set up to use HTTPS:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360028427372/Hubs___Options_-_Change_Hub_Domain_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Options_-_Change_Hub_Domain_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"492\" height=\"275\"></p>\n<p>Seriously, that's all there is to it. The domain you set up with be secured with HTTPS, and you never need to worry about it again: when it's time to renew the certificate, Uberflip will just seamlessly do it for you.</p>\n<h3>Existing HTTP Hubs</h3>\n<p>If you have an existing Hub that uses HTTP, and you want to <strong>switch to HTTPS</strong>, you can do so with the click of a button.</p>\n<p>To switch, click on your name in the top right corner of the Uberflip app, then go to <strong>Account Settings &gt; Services &gt; Domains</strong>. Find the domain in the list, then <strong>click on the <em>Enable HTTPS </em>button</strong> that appears beside it.</p>\n<p>If a pre-provisioned Let's Encrypt certificate is available for your Hub, this will enable HTTPS on the selected domain immediately. If your Let's Encrypt certificate has not yet been provisioned, HTTPS will be enabled as soon as the certificate is ready, typically within a few hours.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>If your Hub <strong>currently uses HTTP</strong> and you have <strong>embedded Hub content elsewhere</strong> (e.g. using the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023374631\" target=\"_self\">Stream Embed</a> or <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020859752\" target=\"_self\">CTA Embed</a> features), <strong>do NOT</strong><strong> proceed</strong>, as this will break your embeds.</p>\n<p>Instead, please <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\">contact Uberflip Support</a> for guidance on what you need to do before making the switch to HTTPS.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What if my Hub already uses HTTPS with a legacy certificate?</h2>\n<h3>Uberflip-Managed Legacy Certificates</h3>\n<p>If you set up HTTPS for your Hub in the past and chose to <strong>let Uberflip handle the certificate setup</strong>, you'll be automatically moved onto a new Let's Encrypt certificate once your current legacy certificate expires. This process is seamless, and you don't need to do anything to make it happen. You shouldn't notice any change, and everything will continue to work just as it did before.</p>\n<h3>Self-Managed Legacy Certificates</h3>\n<p>If you opted to use a <strong>self-managed certificate </strong>with your Hub (i.e. if you sent us a PEM file), you will continue to follow the same process as before: whenever your current certificate expires, you will need to send us a new PEM file.</p>\n<p>In addition, we have also <strong>provisioned a Let's Encrypt certificate for you </strong>as a fallback. If your self-managed certificate expires and you do <strong>not</strong> send us a new PEM file in time, we will automatically transition your Hub onto the Let's Encrypt certificate so that it remains secure.</p>\n<p>If you are currently on a self-managed certificate and want to <strong>switch to a Let's Encrypt certificate</strong>, you can do so at any time. There are a lot of good reasons to switch: you will no longer need to keep track of your certificate expirations, pay for renewals, or prepare and send us a PEM files. If you're interesting in moving from self-managed to automated HTTPS, please <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\" target=\"_self\">contact our Support Team</a>, or get in touch with your CSM.</p>"

To do that, your Form CTA would need the same number of form fields.

If you enable it and set the limit to a more reasonable number (three fields, for example), your conversion rate should improve: now, when a visitor sees this CTA for the first time, they only have to fill in three fields before they can hit the <em>Submit</em> button. As a result, they'll be much more likely to interact with the CTA than if they had to fill in all eight fields.</p>\n<p>But what about the other five fields? Whenever that same visitor sees the same CTA again (for example, gating another piece of content), they'll be shown the next three fields that they hadn't filled out yet. This continues each time that visitor encounters the CTA — until they have completed all the fields, at which point the CTA is no longer shown.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Progressive Profiling will display a specified \"set\" of form fields. Each set consists of the chosen number of fields, formed using <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021266571\">the order specified in the Form CTA settings</a> (<em>Layout &gt; Form Fields &gt; Manage</em>).<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018076451/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"382\" height=\"196\"><br>For example, using the order above, sets consisting of two fields would be: <em>Set 1 [Email, First Name];</em> <em>Set 2 [Last Name, Company Name]</em>.</li>\n<li>The number of fields in a set is a maximum, so it does not need to evenly divide the number of total fields. For example, if you specify that each set contains three fields, but there are eight total fields, this will simply result in in two sets of three fields and one set of two fields.</li>\n<li>Progressive Profiling can be enabled on Form CTAs connected to HubSpot, Marketo, Oracle Eloqua and Pardot, but <strong>not </strong><strong>on</strong><strong> Form CTAs connected to</strong> <strong>MailChimp</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Enable and Configure Progressive Profiling</h2>\n<p>You can turn on Progressive Profiling on any Form CTA connected to a <a href=\"#h_676891933431546447763428'\">supported MAP</a>, but the best place to use it is on the Form CTAs that <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021276731\">gate your most valuable content</a>. In this way, as visitors consume more of your premium content, you can build an increasingly comprehensive profile of them, which can help you to better target them as a prospect.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the Form CTA on which you want to enable Progressive Profiling and click on it to open the <strong>Form CTA Editor</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the Editor, click on the <strong>Layout</strong> tab.<br><br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018077591/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"558\" height=\"135\"><br><br>\n</li>\n<li>Look for the <strong>Progressive Profiling</strong> section on the left and check the box next to <strong>Show a maximum of ___ fields</strong>:<br><br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018077651/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"288\" height=\"352\"><br><br>\n</li>\n<li>Then, use the box to <strong>type in the number of fields</strong> you want to be shown to visitors each time they see the CTA.</li>\n<li>Your changes will be saved automatically, and will be applied immediately.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important: Oracle Eloqua Form CTAs</h4>\n<p>If you are using Progressive Profiling with a Form CTA connected to Oracle Eloqua, note that <strong>all required fields on the connected Eloqua Form must be displayed </strong>the first time the Form CTA is shown to a visitor. In other words, you can't set maximum number of fields displayed to a  number lower than the number of required fields on the Eloqua Form.</p>\n<p>For example, if the Eloqua Form has five required fields, but you have configured the Form CTA to display only four fields to the visitor, the resulting form submission in Eloqua will fail when the visitor submits the Form CTA.</p>\n</div>"

In this article, we'll explain the nuts and bolts of Hub Search.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What's Hub Search?</h2>\n<p>Did you know your Hub has a search function? Visitors to your Hub can access it by clicking this little magnifying glass in the top right corner of your Hub:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360015927051/Content_Experience_Hub___Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Content_Experience_Hub___Uberflip.png\" width=\"702\" height=\"179\"></p>\n<p>...which opens a search box when you click it:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360015881832/Content_Experience_Hub___Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Content_Experience_Hub___Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What can Hub Search find?</h2>\n<p>When you enter a search term, Hub Search will search through all <strong>non-hidden Hub Items</strong> in any of the following Stream types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blogs</li>\n<li>Docs</li>\n<li>Videos</li>\n<li>Marketing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It will not search in Sales Streams (because they're hidden) or in Social Streams.</p>\n<p>Hub Search will look for keyword matches in <strong>titles, descriptions and body content</strong> for <strong>Items</strong>, and in <strong>titles and descriptions only</strong> for <strong>Flipbooks</strong>. If you want, you also have the option of looking for matches among <strong>tags</strong>! To learn how to turn this on, check out <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020275651\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How are search results sorted?</h2>\n<p>All Items in the Hub that match the search query are assigned a relevance score. This is built using various factors, including the number of terms matching the search. The search results are then presented by relevance score, with the highest-scoring (most relevant) items at the top.</p>\n<p>In addition, they are also categorized by the type of content, i.e. Blog, Docs, etc. If there are more than five results for a given category, only the top five are shown, along with a <em>Load More</em> button.</p>\n<p>Also, whenever a new Item is added to the Hub, or Items are deleted or modified, the search database will be updated in near-real-time, so subsequent searches will show updated results.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What about Items that are in multiple Streams?</h2>\n<p>Items can appear in multiple Streams, such as Marketing Streams. If an Item is present in more than one non-hidden Stream, it will still only show up in Hub Search results once.</p>\n<p>The way Hub Search decides which version of the Item to show is to re-run the search with the original search terms, but looking for only matches in the titles and descriptions of the <em>Streams</em> that the Item appears in.</p>\n<p>Hub Search will then display the Item in the context of the Stream with the highest relevance score — unless all scores are the same, in which case the Item is shown in its Source Stream (i.e. the Source Blog Stream, Video Stream, etc.). If the Source Stream is hidden, the Marketing Stream with the lowest ID will be used instead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Additional facts about Hub Search</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Recent searches will be stored in the user's browser, so that whenever they search again, their most recently searched terms will be shown. We store a maximum of 5 recent searches.</li>\n<li>The maximum number of results returned for any search query is 100.</li>\n<li>Search queries must be a minimum of three characters long, otherwise no results will be returned.</li>\n</ul>"

Here's what you need to do to keep your connected Uberflip Blog Streams running smoothly and avoid problems.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Before you begin</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To follow the steps in this guide, you need to be a member of the <strong>Account Administrators</strong> or <strong>Content Managers</strong> user groups.</li>\n<li>Make sure to <strong>read the migration procedure for your chosen option in full</strong> before you proceed.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--danger\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Warning</h4>\n<p><strong>Do NOT take your existing CMS/blog host offline until you have completed the migration procedure!</strong></p>\n<p>If your existing CMS/blog host becomes unavailable before the migration is finished, you will be unable to perform certain key steps, which may make it impossible to complete the migration successfully.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Objective</h2>\n<p>In Uberflip, you can bring content from a blog you host elsewhere (typically in a CMS like WordPress) into your Hub by <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025342851\" target=\"_self\">importing the blog using a Blog Stream</a>. When you do this, you keep maintaining the external blog, and Uberflip automatically pulls in new posts (and can even <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022283332\" target=\"_self\">update older posts when you edit them</a>).</p>\n<p>In this article, you'll learn what you need to do when <strong>moving your external blog to another hosting service (i.e. to another CMS, or into Uberflip)</strong>, in order to ensure that your connected Uberflip Blog Stream experiences minimal disruption. Specifically, the migration procedures described in this article are designed to help you:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Avoid <strong>reimporting</strong> existing content into Uberflip (i.e. duplicate content)</li>\n<li>Avoid <strong>broken images </strong>in blog content</li>\n<li>Avoid <strong>broken</strong> <strong>inline links </strong>in blog content</li>\n<li>Ensure the Blog Stream<strong> continues to update automatically</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Option 1: Move an external blog to a different external hosting service</h2>\n<h4>Use this migration procedure if:</h4>\n<p>You are currently hosting your blog on a service outside Uberflip (such as a CMS, or any other type of blog hosting solution), and want to <strong>move the blog</strong> <strong>to another service outside Uberflip</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>This migration procedure assumes that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are only changing the CMS (or other service) that hosts your blog, and that <strong>the blog itself will otherwise remain unchanged</strong>, i.e. it will still have the same name, be available at the same URL, etc.</li>\n<li>Your new CMS has already been set up and is <strong>ready for migration</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01F4Z6G1YZ6AM2RGV4RY8Z7EGP\">Step 1: Pause automatic updates on the Blog Stream</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p><strong>Pause automatic updates </strong>on the Blog Stream that imports content from the blog that you are moving to a new CMS.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Uberflip, go to the <strong>Content</strong> section.</li>\n<li>Click on the Blog Stream that pulls in posts from your current CMS to open it.</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Options</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>Turn <strong>on</strong> the option <strong>Pause automatic updating of this Stream</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>This will stop the Blog Stream from pulling in further content from the old CMS while you migrate to the new CMS, which helps to avoid creating duplicate content in Uberflip.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Step 2: Set up the RSS feed in the new CMS</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p>Set up the RSS feed in your new CMS on <strong>the same URL </strong>and with <strong>the same GUID format</strong>.</p>\n<p>How you do this will vary depending on your CMS, so you should speak with your CMS administrator. What you need to accomplish is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up the RSS feed in your new CMS on <strong>the exact same URL</strong> as the RSS feed in your old CMS.</li>\n<li>Set up the GUID format for posts in the new CMS's RSS feed to <strong>exactly match the GUID format</strong> used by the old CMS's RSS feed.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>There are multiple ways to format GUIDs. While the most widely used option is to use the item's <strong>direct URL </strong>as its GUID, another common approach is to use <strong>ID codes</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you use an ID code format for your GUIDs, try to configure your new CMS so that it assigns ID codes to RSS feed items in a way that is <strong>consistent</strong> with the old CMS: for example, if a given blog post had the ID code <em>ABC123</em> in the old CMS, the new CMS should give that same ID code to the same blog post when it assigns GUIDs.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>Your existing Blog Stream is configured to look at a particular RSS feed URL (like <em>https://www.mycompany.com/blog/feed/</em>) for new posts, so by setting up the RSS feed in the new CMS on the exact same URL, you ensure that the Blog Stream can keep pulling in new posts.</p>\n<p>Likewise, GUIDs uniquely identify posts in an RSS feed. Your Blog Stream keeps track of the GUIDs for all of the posts it has imported, and uses these GUIDs to avoid importing the same post more than once. By keeping the formats of the GUIDs the same between the old and new CMS, you ensure that your Blog Stream won't view old posts on your new CMS as \"new\" content and import it (creating duplicates).</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Migrate images</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p>If you are using your old CMS to host the images used in your blog, <strong>migrate the images</strong> to your new CMS, then <strong>find and replace the image URLs</strong> to update them (if needed).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are moving from one CMS to another CMS, there will likely be a built-in process to migrate images from one system to another. Speak with your CMS administrator for details.</li>\n<li>After performing this migration, you will also need to export a<strong> list of image URLs from your old CMS</strong>, and a corresponding <strong>list</strong><strong> of image URLs in your new CMS</strong>, and provide these to your Uberflip representative.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>If you host blog images on your old CMS, those images will no longer be available when you take the old CMS out of service, which results in broken images in your blog posts. To ensure images remain available, you must migrate them to be hosted on the new CMS.</p>\n<p>This migration will allow images to be displayed correctly when the blog is hosted on the new CMS, but will not affect posts that Uberflip previously imported from the old CMS. These posts will still reference the old URLs where the images used to be hosted, and will therefore be broken. To ensure the images in these blog posts are still displayed correctly, the old image URLs must be found and replaced. If you provide a list of old image URLs, and their counterparts in your new CMS, your Uberflip representative can perform this find-and-replace action for you.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Create a new Blog Stream to test the new RSS feed</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p><strong>Add a new Blog Stream</strong> in Uberflip to test the RSS feed in your new CMS.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In your Uberflip account, add a new Blog Stream and <strong>specify the RSS feed from the new CMS</strong>.</li>\n<li>Review the Blog Stream to <strong>check that everything looks normal</strong>, i.e. posts look as expected, images are coming in, etc.</li>\n<li>If there are no problems, <strong>archive the Blog Stream</strong> to remove the duplicate content it created from your Hub.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>Creating a new Blog Stream for testing allows you to check that the RSS feed in the new CMS has been configured correctly without affecting the existing Blog Stream. The test Blog Stream will be a duplicate of the existing one, so you can archive it once testing is complete (as it is no longer needed at that point).</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Test importing from the new RSS feed with a limited number of posts</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p>In the new CMS, <strong>limit the number of posts in the RSS feed to a small number</strong>, then <strong>resume automatic updates on the Blog Stream</strong> to test the import.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the RSS feed settings for your blog, set the number of posts to a small number (under 10).</li>\n<li>In Uberflip, resume automatic updates on the connected Blog Stream. To do so, simply follow the instructions in <a href=\"#h_01F4Z6G1YZ6AM2RGV4RY8Z7EGP\" target=\"_self\">Step 1</a> again, and turn <strong>Pause automatic updating of this Stream</strong> back to the <strong>off</strong> setting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>Limiting the number of posts in the RSS feed will ensure that only a small amount of posts will be imported into your Uberflip Blog Stream once you resume automatic updates. This helps to minimize the impact in case the GUID formats were not matched correctly, which would cause duplicate content to be imported.</p>\n<h3>Step 6: Increase the number of posts in the RSS feed</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p>As a final step, once you have confirmed that no duplicate content is being brought into Uberflip, <strong>increase the number of posts in the RSS feed to the normal amount</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>The maximum number of posts that Uberflip can import from your blog is limited in part by the number of posts included in the blog's RSS feed (up to a maximum of 200). By increasing the number of posts in the RSS feed, you can not only ensure that all new posts are brought in to the Blog Stream, but also that older posts in the Stream can be updated automatically if you modify the corresponding posts in the original blog (as long as the post is still in the RSS feed).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Option 2: Move an external blog into Uberflip</h2>\n<h4>Use this migration procedure if:</h4>\n<p>You are currently hosting your blog on a service outside Uberflip (like a CMS), and want to <strong>host your blog directly in Uberflip</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>This migration procedure assumes that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are <strong>winding down your existing CMS</strong> or other service that currently hosts your blog (or are migrating just the blog off this service while still maintaining it for other uses).</li>\n<li>Your existing CMS is <strong>still online</strong>.</li>\n<li>You will continue to maintain the blog, and want to <strong>use Uberflip's built-in blogging functions</strong> to create <strong>all further posts</strong> on this blog.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01F4Z6G1YZ6AM2RGV4RY8Z7EGP\">Step 1: Pause automatic updates on the Blog Stream</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p><strong>Pause automatic updates </strong>on the Blog Stream that imports content from the blog that you are moving to Uberflip.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Uberflip, go to the <strong>Content</strong> section.</li>\n<li>Click on the Blog Stream that pulls in posts from your current CMS to open it.</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Options</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>Turn <strong>on</strong> the option <strong>Pause automatic updating of this Stream</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>This will stop the Blog Stream from pulling in further content from the old CMS while you migrate the blog to Uberflip. As you will be blogging in Uberflip, this function is no longer necessary, and turning it off can help to avoid accidentally creating duplicate content.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Migrate images</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p>If you are using your old CMS to host the images used in your blog, <strong>migrate the images</strong> to Uberflip.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To migrate images from your old CMS to Uberflip hosting, <strong>install and use the Image Migrator app</strong>. You can download it from the Uberflip Marketplace <a href=\"https://marketplace.uberflip.com/details/image-migrator/\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>See <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039098812\" target=\"_self\">this article</a> for instructions on how to use Image Migrator. Note especially the <strong>requirements</strong> for both your Uberflip account and for images before proceeding.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>If your Uberflip account does not meet the requirements to use Image Migrator (e.g. API access), speak with your Uberflip representative to arrange<strong> temporary access</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>If you host blog images on your CMS, those images will no longer be available when you take the CMS out of service, which results in broken images in your blog posts. To ensure images remain available, you must migrate them to be hosted in Uberflip.</p>\n<p>The Image Migrator app is designed specifically for this purpose. It downloads all of the blog post images from your old CMS and uploads them to Uberflip hosting. Then, it finds image URLs that point to the old CMS in your existing Blog Stream and replaces them with new Uberflip-hosted image URLs to ensure they keep working.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Update inline links</h3>\n<h4>Do this:</h4>\n<p><strong>Find-and-replace</strong> <strong>any inline links</strong> in your blog posts that point to the blog's old URL.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Uberflip representative will do this for you: simply <strong>let them know how the URLs of inline links has</strong> <strong>changed</strong>.</li>\n<li>For example, if your blog used to live at the URL <em>https://www.mycompany.com/resources/blog/</em>, and will now live in your Uberflip Hub at <em>https://hub.mycompany.com/blog/</em>, then any link in your old blog posts like <em>www.mycompany.com/resources/blog/example-post </em>would need to be updated to <em>hub.mycompany.com/blog/example-post </em>to keep working.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>When you move your blog from your CMS to Uberflip, this will change the URL where your blog is located (from the URL defined in the CMS to the URL of the Blog Stream). When you take the CMS offline, any links that point to the old URL will be broken. This includes inline links you may have included in old blog posts, i.e. links to other posts in the same blog. To ensure these links keep working, you need to find-and-replace links that point to the old URL so that they point to the new URL instead. As this may involve searching many hundreds of blog posts for affected links, Uberflip is able to automate this action for you.</p>"

By default, these tags are only displayed in the Uberflip app, and are not included when an Item is viewed in the Hub's front end. To make these tags available to app like Clearbit Personalizer, you must enable the setting <strong>Include Item tags for Custom Code</strong><em>. </em></p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>This setting is Hub-specific, so you must <strong>enable it separately in each Hub</strong> where you want to use Clearbit Personalizer.</p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Uberflip account and use the <strong>Hubs</strong> menu to select the Hub where you want to enable the setting.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Hub Options &gt; Advanced</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under the section <strong>Content Experience</strong>, check the box next to <strong>Include Item tags for Custom Code</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4410710740749/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The change will be saved automatically, and will take effect immediately.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Configuring the Clearbit Personalizer app</h2>\n<p>To use Clearbit Personalizer in your Uberflip account, configure the app's settings. These settings control the app's functionality, and how it is applied to your Hubs and Streams.</p>\n<p>You can configure settings for Clearbit Personalizer at the <strong>Account Level</strong>, the <strong>Hub Level</strong>, the <strong>Stream Level</strong>, or all three:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any settings you configure at the <strong>Account Level</strong> will apply to <strong>all Hubs</strong> in your account.</li>\n<li>Any settings you configure at the <strong>Hub Level</strong> will apply to <strong>that Hub only</strong>. If you have also configured Account Level settings, Hub Level settings will override them for that specific Hub.</li>\n<li>Any settings you configure at the <strong>Stream Level</strong> will apply to <strong>that Stream</strong> <strong>only</strong>. If you have also configured Account and/or Hub Level settings, Stream Level settings will override them for that specific Stream.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of this app's settings can only be configured at certain levels. The level(s) at which any given setting are available are indicated beside each setting below.</p>\n<p>For instructions on how to access Account, Hub, and Stream Level settings for any Uberflip Marketplace app, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042582411\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Configure settings for Uberflip Marketplace apps</a>.</p>\n<h3>Reveal API Key</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-primary\">Required</span> This setting is used to specify your Clearbit Reveal API key, which activates the app and allows it to access the Clearbit API.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To activate the app, enter your Clearbit Reveal API key into the field.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01F8DX36N57PJ1BA9VG587S4ST\">Enable</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> This setting is used to enable the Clearbit Personalizer app for the current Stream.</p>\n<p>When this setting is turned on, the app will be active on the current Stream, using the settings you have defined at the Stream Level.

For example, if a visitor's Clearbit data indicates that their industry is <em>Financial Services</em>, then the Stream will be filtered to show Items that you have tagged as relating to the financial services industry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order for this functionality to work, you must set up Clearbit <strong>Attribute</strong> <strong>Tags</strong> in your Uberflip account, and add them to all Items in Streams where Clearbit Personalizer is active. See <a href=\"#h_01FH98GSMJA37GMSM1NDE9Y15H\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Using Attribute Tags</a> for more information.</li>\n<li>When <em>Filter Items by Tags</em> is enabled, an Item must have at least one Attribute Tag matching <em>any </em>attribute in the visitor's Clearbit data to be displayed. Items that do not have at least one matching Attribute Tag (or which have no Attribute Tags) will not be displayed.</li>\n<li>If an Item has multiple Attribute Tags, only one of these tags needs to match the visitor's data for that Item to be displayed.</li>\n<li>By default, the minimum number of matching Items that will be displayed is one. If no Items in a Stream have Attribute Tags that match the visitor's Clearbit data, <strong>all</strong> Items in the Stream will be shown (to avoid showing the visitor an empty Stream).<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Using the <a href=\"#h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Show Always Tag</a> changes this behavior. If you use the Show Always Tag, then only Items that have the Show Always Tag will be displayed in this situation (rather than all Items in the Stream).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When a Stream is filtered, the order in which the Items are shown will still be the same as in the original (unfiltered) Stream, except with the filtered Items hidden. For example, if five Items in a Stream are in the order 1-2-3-4-5 and Items 1 and 4 are filtered out, the Stream will still display the remaining Items in the order 2-3-5.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>If you want to use <em>Filter Items by Tags</em>, it's not necessary to tag all the Items in your Hub! To get started, try tagging just the Items in the Streams where this app is enabled.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h_01FH98GSMJA37GMSM1NDE9Y15H\">Using Attribute Tags</h4>\n<p>To use the <strong><a href=\"#h_01FH95ZQRMZVX0F46Q0CHWJ25D\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Filter Items by Tags</a></strong> functionality, you must add <strong>Attribute Tags</strong> to all Items that appear in Streams where Clearbit Personalizer is enabled. Attribute Tags are specially-formatted tags which you use to indicate to Clearbit Personalizer which content Items should be displayed if a visitor has a given attribute in their Clearbit data.</p>\n<p>To apply an Attribute Tag to an Item, simply add it to the Item in the same way as a normal Item Tag (see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\">Use Tags on your Items</a> for instructions)<a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\" target=\"_self\">.</a> Attribute Tags use the following structure:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">clearbit.[attribute].[subattribute].[value]</code></p>\n<p>Within this basic format, replace:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">[attribute]</code> with the Clearbit main attribute.</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">[subattribute]</code> with a Clearbit secondary attribute that belongs to the main attribute chosen, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">city</code>for the main attribute <code class=\"no-padding\">geo</code>.\n<ul>\n<li>If you choose an attribute that does not have a subattribute, simply omit this section, i.e. use the format <code class=\"no-padding\">clearbit.[attribute].[value]</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">[value]</code>with the attribute’s desired value. For example, the tag <code class=\"no-padding\">clearbit.geo.city.Chicago</code> would indicate that the tagged Item should be displayed if a visitor’s city attribute in Clearbit is \"Chicago\", and would therefore be applied to Items relevant to that topic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that values in the tags must match Clearbit values <strong>exactly</strong>: any spaces, parentheses, etc. that exist in the Clearbit value must also exist in the tag. For a list of Clearbit's main and secondary attributes and values, contact your Clearbit representative.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\">Using the Show Always Tag</h4>\n<p>You can choose to always display certain Items, regardless of the visitor's Clearbit data. To do this, use the <strong>Show Always Tag</strong>:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">clearbit.show</code></p>\n<p>This tag is created automatically when you install Clearbit Personalizer. To use it, simply add it to any Items that you want to always be displayed in Streams where Clearbit Personalizer is active (provided the Item has been added to the Stream). This is useful for content that is relevant to a very wide audience and should be shown to all visitors, as well as to avoid instances where only one or two Items would be shown in the Stream based on Attribute Tags alone.</p>\n<p>If you use the Show Always Tag, keep in mind that the filtered Stream will still respect the Item order set for the full Stream. As a result, we recommend placing Items with the Show Always Tag either at the beginning or end of the Stream (depending on the content).</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>Do not delete the Show Always Tag from your Uberflip account, even if you don't use it on any Items! Clearbit Personalizer requires this tag to be present to enable key app functionality.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>This app filters not just Items on the main Stream page, but also the additional Items displayed when viewing an Item in that Stream. While viewing an Item, the <em>Next/Previous Item</em> area and the <em>Other Content in This Stream</em> carousel will be filtered in the same way as the main Stream page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the carousel, filtered Items will take priority, and any additional free slots in the carousel (after all filtered Items have been displayed) will be filled with non-filtered Items from the same Stream</li>\n<li>If no next or previous filtered Item is available, the <em>Next/Previous Item</em> area will be hidden</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_b000deae-dc03-454b-a70d-e6feae3faacb\">Swap Logo</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level | Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> This setting is used to control Clearbit Personalizer's dynamic logo functionality.</p>\n<p>When this setting is turned on, the app will use a visitor's Clearbit data to search Clearbit's Logo API for the logo of the visitor's organization.

We recommend using a generic logo for this purpose (e.g. a logo that just says \"You\" or similar).</p>\n<p>We also recommend specifying a default <em>Banner Title</em> under the <em>Appearance </em>tab to be displayed in case no logo is found and the logos are hidden from the banner. If you do not specify a <em>Banner Title</em>, only a blank header (or <em>Banner Image</em>, if specified) will be shown.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_fda0dc92-8776-4a7d-9223-a364f8d1ca02\">Remove Logos When No Match Found</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level | Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> (enabled by default if you have turned on the <a href=\"#h_b000deae-dc03-454b-a70d-e6feae3faacb\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Swap Logo</a> setting).

These fields are used to populate the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612952\" target=\"_self\">Open Graph and Twitter Card tags</a> that social platforms use to generate link previews, and any text you put in them will appear in the preview — including the placeholder text itself, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">{clearbit.name}</code> instead of the relevant company name.</li>\n<li>For Marketing and Sales Streams, we recommend enabling the <strong><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020637332-Personalize-a-Marketing-or-Sales-Stream\">Banner+Logo template</a></strong> under the Stream's <em>Appearance</em> tab, as this will allow you to use the <a href=\"#h_b000deae-dc03-454b-a70d-e6feae3faacb\" target=\"_self\"><em>Swap Logo</em></a> setting. If you select this template, you should also enable the <strong>Hide Stream Title</strong> option and specify a <strong>Banner Title</strong> (also under the <em>Appearance</em> tab). There are two benefits to doing this:\n<ul>\n<li>If the <a href=\"#h_fda0dc92-8776-4a7d-9223-a364f8d1ca02\" target=\"_self\"><em>Remove Logos When No Match Found</em></a> option is turned on and no logo matches are found, the Banner Title will be shown on the banner instead (rather than an empty banner image).</li>\n<li>If you intend to share the Stream on social media, you can put a placeholder in the Banner Title field (as this isn't shown in the social media preview), but not in the regular Stream Title field (which is shown on social media). In other words, this allows you to personalize the title that a visitor to the Stream sees, without the placeholder text appearing when the same Stream is shared on a social media platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For all Streams and Items that you don't plan to share on social media, but which you expect to be indexed by Google, we recommend using the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612892\" target=\"_self\"><strong>SEO Title and SEO Description fields</strong></a>. These allow you to specify alternative titles and descriptions for your Streams and Items when they appear on Google search result pages. You can use these fields to ensure that any placeholders you put in a Stream's or Item's title/description do not appear when that Stream or Item appears on Google.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>If you experience problems with this app's functionality, this may be due to corrupted data. To resolve the issue, try clearing your browser's cache (or try using the app in Incognito Mode to see if that resolves the issue).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>For developers</h2>\n<p>Because this app manipulates a large portion of Stream and Item pages, a race condition can occur, which can cause other JavaScript <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_self\">custom code</a> running on the same page to malfunction. </p>\n<p>If your JS code performs other manipulations on pages where this app is active, you should ensure it runs <strong>after</strong> the app to avoid problems. To help you do this, a <strong>callback functio</strong><strong>n </strong>is built into the app that will be called once the app has finished executing its own code.</p>\n<p>To leverage the callback function, create a function named <code class=\"no-padding\">ufPersonalizerCallback</code> in your own custom code and place your JS inside it. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;<br>var ufPersonalizerCallback = function(){<br> /** Your JS **/<br>};<br>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>"

To work around this, you can use a text field in Marketo and make the corresponding Form CTA field a <em>Select (Drop Down)</em> field.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Manage Form Fields</h2>\n<p>To begin customizing form fields on a Form CTA, you'll need to open the <em>Manage Fields</em> menu.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the Form CTA on which you want to customize the form fields and click on it to open the <strong>Form CTA Editor</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the Editor, click on the <strong>Layout</strong> tab.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018077591/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"558\" height=\"135\">\n</li>\n<li>Look for the <strong>Form Fields</strong> section and click on the <strong>Manage</strong> link:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018217772/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Manage Fields</strong> menu will open as an overlay, and you can now begin customizing the form fields on the selected Form CTA.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Rearrange Form Fields</h2>\n<p>Within the Form CTA, form fields are ordered vertically, one field per line. You can modify the order in which these fields appear within the Form CTA:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the <strong>Manage Fields</strong> menu, you will see a list of <strong>Existing Fields</strong>. The order in which the fields appear here is how they will appear in the Form CTA shown to visitors:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018092771/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>To reorder the fields, simply<strong> click and hold</strong> on a field you want to move, then <strong>drag it</strong> to where you want it to appear in the list.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018093471/Kapture_2019-01-02_at_16.05.53.gif\" alt=\"Kapture_2019-01-02_at_16.05.53.gif\">\n</li>\n<li>The new order will be saved automatically and applied immediately.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_864750515331548368832425\">Add Form Fields</h2>\n<p>You can add as many form fields as you like (though if you plan to add more than four or five fields, we recommend using <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021016412\">Progressive Profiling</a> to optimize the effectiveness of your Form CTA). Each new form field you add must be linked to an existing field in the Marketing Automation Platform (MAP) connected to the CTA. This MAP field is where information entered into the form field will be recorded.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note: Oracle Eloqua Form Fields</h4>\n<p>When a Form CTA is connected to Oracle Eloqua, it integrates directly with an Eloqua Form. As a result:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All available fields on the Eloqua Form will automatically be added to the Form CTA</li>\n<li>Only fields already configured on the Eloqua Form will be available to add to the Form CTA. To add further form fields, you must first add them to the Eloqua Form (in Eloqua).</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>In the <strong>Manage Fields </strong> menu, click on the <strong>+Add New</strong> button in the top right.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018093831/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Add New Field </strong>menu will appear. Begin by using the <strong>Search</strong> field to identify the corresponding field in your MAP.

See the <a href=\"#h_78012f27-4c8a-4c76-8f94-2b4bfffb3b0e\" target=\"_self\">reference guide</a> below for more information about the available types.</li>\n<li>If you choose the <strong>Text</strong> or <strong>Select (Drop Down)</strong> form field types, check the box next to <strong>Required</strong> below if you want to make the form field mandatory.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Displays</strong>, you can configure if you want to make this form field conditional (if available). For information about using this feature, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020221931\">this article</a>.</li>\n<li>When you are finished, click on <strong>Save</strong>. You'll be returned to the main <strong>Manage Fields</strong> menu, where your new field will now be listed:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018096811/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"318\">\n</li>\n<li>The new form field will also appear under the <strong>Form Fields</strong> section in the Form CTA Editor, but it will be unchecked by default. To add a newly added form field to your CTA, you must check its box here first:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018225672/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Your changes will be saved automatically and applied immediately.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"h_78012f27-4c8a-4c76-8f94-2b4bfffb3b0e\">Reference: Field Types</h3>\n<p>There are five field types you can choose from:</p>\n<div class=\"tabs\">\n<div class=\"tabs-menu\">\n<span class=\"tabs-link is-active\">Text</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Select (Drop Down)</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Checkbox</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Hidden</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Label Only</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab\">\n<p>The default option.

Once this option is selected, a <strong>Field Options</strong> section will appear that shows the list options provided by the MAP:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018224032/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"383\" height=\"365\"></p>\n<p>If desired, you can reorder and rename the list options shown.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip: CSV Upload Option</h4>\n<p>Need to create a lot of options for your dropdown menu? If your Form CTA is connected to <strong>Marketo</strong> or <strong>Pardot</strong>, you also have the option of uploading a CSV file containing all the options, rather than creating them manually. To use this option, simply click the <strong>Upload</strong> button that appears next to <strong>Field Options</strong>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360036532031/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>Then, choose the a CSV file from your computer to upload. The file must be in .csv format and consist of two columns: column 1 must contain the labels, and column 2 must contain the corresponding values.</p>\n<p>Note that this option is not available for Form CTAs connected to HubSpot, Oracle Eloqua, or MailChimp.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab is-hidden\">\n<p>Presents a labeled checkbox that visitors can choose to check or not check:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018224492/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>Checkbox form fields can't be set as mandatory.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab is-hidden\">\n<p>Adds a form field that is not visible to visitors. This is useful for passing a unique value to your MAP each time a CTA is submitted in order to track metrics on that CTA.

            "body": "<hr>\n<p>Got a question about Sales Assist? Here are some answers to the most commonly asked questions about Sales Assist.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>When I create my own content Items, how does Sales Assist set the thumbnail image?</h2>\n<p>When you create your own content Item, Sales Assist will look in the metadata of the content to try and find a thumbnail image. If it can find a suitable image, it uses it to create a thumbnail for the Item.</p>\n<p>If there is no suitable image in the metadata, Sales Assist can't create a thumbnail. When that happens, you can simply edit the Item to add an image of your choice (either from a URL, or from Sales Assist's image library).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>I can't add an image to my content Item. What's going wrong?</h2>\n<p>The most common cause of this problem is using a URL that does not point directly to an image file. This usually happens with images you copy from Google Image Search. For example, this URL will display an image, but it's not the actual image URL, so it won't work:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/ZH4t1ZkPNevDmG3v9\">https://images.app.goo.gl/ZH4t1ZkPNevDmG3v9</a></p>\n<p>What you're looking for is a URL that ends with an image file extension, like<em> .jpg</em> or <em>.png</em>. In Chrome, you can get this by right-clicking on an image, then clicking on <em>Copy image address</em>. If you do that on the image in the link above, you'll get this (valid) image URL instead:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uberflip.com/assets/logos/uberflip-logo-white-rubine.png\">https://uberflip.com/assets/logos/uberflip-logo-white-rubine.png</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>If I create a content Item using a link to Google Docs (or Slides, Sheets, etc.), what do I need to do before sharing it with a prospect?</h2>\n<p>To ensure that they can see the content, you need to set up the <em>Share </em>permissions for the Google Doc to give at least your recipient \"Can view\" permission. If you expect the recipient to share the content with others in their organization, you have two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can set the <em>Share</em> permissions for the Google Doc to \"Anyone with the link can view\", which allows the recipient to freely share it with others. If you choose this option, remember that <em>anyone</em> will be able to see the content, so be careful with sensitive content.</li>\n<li>As an alternative, you can also simply leave the permissions set to only your intended recipient initially. When they share the content, additional people who want to view it will be prompted to request permission: these requests will be sent to you, which allows you to capture new potential leads within a sales cycle (as well as retain access control over sensitive content).</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>When I create a content Item using a link to Dropbox, why does it show \"View File on Dropbox\" instead of the file itself?</h2>\n<p>Dropbox prevents content that it hosts from being displayed in an iframe, so when you create an Item in Sales Assist using a Dropbox link, it'll always show a \"View File on Dropbox\" message rather than the content itself.</p>\n<p>In general, we recommend using a service other than Dropbox to host files that you want to use with Sales Assist. If you must use Dropbox, the <a href=\"https://marketplace.uberflip.com/details/iframer/\"><strong>iFramer</strong></a> app has a feature that allows content from Dropbox to be iframed. Sales Assist integrates automatically with iFramer, so if you install iFramer and configure it to display Dropbox content, Sales Assist will display Dropbox content as well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What happens to notifications that come in while Sales Assist is not open?</h2>\n<p>Sales Assist will display notifications as long as it is open and logged in somewhere in your browser: either in an open tab (even if it's not the active tab), or in the Chrome extension.</p>\n<p>If Sales Assist is not currently logged in and open anywhere, it will hold any notifications that come in and display them the next time the user logs in to Sales Assist. Plus, you can also view past activity notifications in the <em>Shares</em> section of the app.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Why won't the Chrome extension open on some tabs?</h2>\n<p>The Chrome extension is basically an iframe of the Sales Assist app. Some websites, such as LinkedIn, do not allow iframes to be displayed. As a result, the Sales Assist extension won't open whenever the active browser tab is displaying a website that restricts iframes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Why did Sales Assist not notify me when someone viewed a DSR or content Item that I shared with them?</h2>\n<p>Sales Assist can only notify you of views for links generated by Sales Assist. These links contain a special \"share token\" that allows the app to identify when someone visits the linked page. If you simply share the regular DSR or Item URL, this doesn't include the share token, so Sales Assist has no way of knowing (and notifying you) when someone visits the page.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Can I hide certain Items or Streams so that they don't show up in Sales Assist?</h2>\n<p>Sales Assist uses Uberflip's built-in <em>Show in Extensions</em> Stream setting to determine whether or not to surface content in Search: if this setting is turned off for a Stream, Items in that Stream won't be displayed in Sales Assist.</p>\n<p>To turn off this setting for any Stream, open the Stream in Uberflip and click on the <em>Options</em> tab, then toggle the <em>Show in Extensions </em>setting to the off position.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>If an Uberflip Item is set up to redirect the visitor to its canonical URL, will Sales Assist send a notification if a recipient visits that Item?</h2>\n<p>In order to track whether a link was visited and send a notification to the user who shared it, Sales Assist needs the linked page to finish loading. With an Item that redirects to a canonical URL this wouldn't happen, so for these Items, Sales Assist is not able to do tracking and notifications.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>In what order does Sales Assist show Items in the <em>Search</em> section? Can I change the way the search results are ordered?</h2>\n<p>By default, Sales Assist orders content search results (i.e. Items displayed in the <em>Search</em> section) based on how often they've been shared: the more an Item has been shared, the higher up it appears. Share count is determined by the number of Sales and Marketing Streams an Item has been added to, so an Item that has been added to a total of 10 Marketing and/or Sales Streams would rank higher than one that's only in 3 Streams.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can also order search results by publish date (newest first), or alphabetically by title.</p>"

For example, if a visitor's RollWorks data indicates that their industry is <em>Financial Services</em>, then the Stream will be filtered to show Items that you have tagged as relating to the financial services industry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order for this functionality to work, you must set up RollWorks <strong>Attribute</strong> <strong>Tags</strong> in your Uberflip account, and add them to all Items in Streams where RollWorks Personalizer is active.

To get started, try tagging just the Items in the Streams where this app is enabled.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h_01FH9FG4SJ63ZRDPCA2Q6HT29Q\">Using Attribute Tags</h4>\n<p>To use the <strong><a href=\"#h_01FH9FHMZ76SD5783VGP1N1ACN\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Filter Items by Tags</a></strong> functionality, you must add <strong>Attribute Tags</strong> to all Items that appear in Streams where RollWorks Personalizer is enabled. Attribute Tags are specially-formatted tags which you use to indicate to RollWorks Personalizer which content Items should be displayed if a visitor has a given attribute in their RollWorks data.</p>\n<p>To apply an Attribute Tag to an Item, simply add it to the Item in the same way as a normal Item Tag (see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\">Use Tags on your Items</a> for instructions)<a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\" target=\"_self\">.</a> Attribute Tags use the following structure:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">rollworks.[attribute].[value]</code></p>\n<p>Within this basic format, replace:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">[attribute]</code> with the RollWorks attribute, one of:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">company_revenue</code> for the annual revenue (as a general band) of the visitor's company</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">company_size</code> for the number of employees (as a general band) of the visitor's company</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">company_industry</code> for the industry of the visitor's company</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">company_name</code> for the name of the visitor's company</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">domain</code> for the web domain of the visitor's company</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"no-padding\">[value]</code>with the attribute’s desired value. For example, the tag <code class=\"no-padding\">rollworks.company_revenue.Small ($1MM-$10MM)</code> would indicate that the tagged Item should be displayed if a visitor’s company revenue falls into the \"Small\" band, and would therefore be applied to Items relevant to that topic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that values in tag names must match RollWorks values <strong>exactly</strong>: any spaces, parentheses, etc. that exist in the RollWorks value must also exist in the tag. See <a href=\"#h_0c4d72cb-4bfe-4cc7-a643-74bea841a750\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Available RollWorks attributes</a> below for a list of RollWorks attributes and example values.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\">Using the Show Always Tag</h4>\n<p>You can choose to always display certain Items, regardless of the visitor's RollWorks data. To do this, use the <strong>Show Always Tag</strong>:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">rollworks.show</code></p>\n<p>This tag is created automatically when you install RollWorks Personalizer. To use it, simply add it to any Items that you want to always be displayed in Streams where RollWorks Personalizer is active (provided the Item has been added to the Stream). This is useful for content that is relevant to a very wide audience and should be shown to all visitors, as well as to avoid instances where only one or two Items would be shown in the Stream based on Attribute Tags alone.</p>\n<p>If you use the Show Always Tag, keep in mind that the filtered Stream will still respect the Item order set for the full Stream. As a result, we recommend placing Items with the Show Always Tag either at the beginning or end of the Stream (depending on the content).</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>Do not delete the Show Always Tag from your Uberflip account, even if you don't use it on any Items!

These fields are used to populate the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612952\" target=\"_self\">Open Graph and Twitter Card tags</a> that social platforms use to generate link previews, and any text you put in them will appear in the preview — including the placeholder text itself, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">{rollworks.company_name}</code> instead of the relevant company name.</li>\n<li>For Marketing and Sales Streams, we recommend enabling the <strong><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020637332-Personalize-a-Marketing-or-Sales-Stream\">Banner+Logo template</a></strong> under the Stream's <em>Appearance</em> tab, as this will allow you to use the <a href=\"#h_3c68ada0-145d-4af1-91b7-b444ec5d1bb9\" target=\"_self\"><em>Swap Logo</em></a> setting. If you select this template, you should also enable the <strong>Hide Stream Title</strong> option and specify a <strong>Banner Title</strong> (also under the <em>Appearance</em> tab). There are two benefits to doing this:\n<ul>\n<li>If the <a href=\"#h_1b875855-b03a-4e40-98f5-d6b4c66e0de5\" target=\"_self\"><em>Remove Logos When No Match Found</em></a> option is turned on and no logo matches are found, the Banner Title will be shown on the banner instead (rather than an empty banner image).</li>\n<li>If you intend to share the Stream on social media, you can put a placeholder in the Banner Title field (as this isn't shown in the social media preview), but not in the regular Stream Title field (which is shown on social media). In other words, this allows you to personalize the title that a visitor to the Stream sees, without the placeholder text appearing when the same Stream is shared on a social media platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For all Streams and Items that you don't plan to share on social media, but which you expect to be indexed by Google, we recommend using the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612892\" target=\"_self\"><strong>SEO Title and SEO Description fields</strong></a>. These allow you to specify alternative titles and descriptions for your Streams and Items when they appear on Google search result pages. You can use these fields to ensure that any placeholders you put in a Stream's or Item's title/description do not appear when that Stream or Item appears on Google.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>If you experience problems with this app's functionality, this may be due to corrupted data. To resolve the issue, try clearing your browser's cache (or try using the app in Incognito Mode to see if that resolves the issue).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>For developers</h2>\n<p>Because this app manipulates a large portion of Stream and Item pages, a race condition can occur, which can cause other JavaScript <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_self\">custom code</a> running on the same page to malfunction. </p>\n<p>If your JS code performs other manipulations on pages where this app is active, you should ensure it runs <strong>after</strong> the app to avoid problems. To help you do this, a <strong>callback functio</strong><strong>n </strong>is built into the app that will be called once the app has finished executing its own code.</p>\n<p>To leverage the callback function, create a function named <code class=\"no-padding\">ufPersonalizerCallback</code> in your own custom code and place your JS inside it. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;<br>var ufPersonalizerCallback = function(){<br> /** Your JS **/<br>};<br>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>"

If you're already hosting your video content on Wistia, you can easily make it part of your content experiences by bringing it into your Hub with our Wistia integration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_efca44e5-cfad-4c34-a33b-680b83acd4e1\">Recommended: Create a Dedicated Uberflip User in Wistia</h2>\n<p>To integrate your Wistia account with your Hub and pull in your videos, Uberflip will access your Wistia account through a standard user account. This could be any account, but we recommend <strong>not</strong> using an account belonging to a specific person: if that person changes their password or their account is deactivated (i.e. if they leave your organization), the integration between Uberflip and Wistia will break.</p>\n<p>Instead, our recommendation is to create an \"Uberflip Integration\" user in your Wistia account that is dedicated to this integration. You can create this user with any name and other details you like, but it must have the <strong>Manager</strong> role. Once you've created your user, it's also a good idea to share its credentials with your team so that anyone can manage the integration if something goes wrong.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Create a Wistia Stream</h2>\n<p>All you have to do to connect your Hub to Wistia and pull in content from your account is create a new Wistia Stream. Once you have created a Wistia Stream, it will remain connected to the Wistia project you specify during creation, and will continue to pull in any new content you publish there automatically.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>Each Wistia Stream you create will be associated with a particular Wistia project within the connected account.

But if you prefer to use your own SSL certificate, you'll need to send it to us. Here's how.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Before You Begin</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To use self-managed SSL with your Hub, you must <strong>own an SSL</strong> <strong>certificate</strong>. If you do not have an SSL certificate, you will need to<strong> purchase one</strong> <strong>from a valid Certificate Authority (CA) vendor</strong> before you can proceed.</li>\n<li>If at all possible, <strong>we strongly recommend using the <em>Let's Encrypt</em> certificate</strong> that is <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028190551\" target=\"_self\">automatically provisioned for your Hub</a>. Doing so has numerous benefits over self-managed certificates, including lower cost (LE certificates are free of charge) and ease of maintenance (Uberflip automatically renews LE certificates for you).</li>\n<li>Although we use the term \"SSL\" throughout this article and elsewhere, this is only out of convention. More properly, any use of the term \"SSL\" in this context should always be taken to mean TLS, which is the technology that is actually used.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_150083404321541458362814\">Send Your SSL Certificate to Uberflip</h2>\n<p>Because Uberflip is a SaaS platform, your Hubs and the content on them are delivered from Uberflip's servers — even if visitors are accessing the Hub via your custom domain. This means that Uberflip needs to <strong>install your SSL certificate on our servers</strong>, so you must securely transmit it to Uberflip.</p>\n<h3>Certificate Format</h3>\n<p>You can send the certificate in any valid file format, but we prefer certificates in <strong>PEM format </strong>(i.e. certificate files with a <em>.pem, .crt, .cer,</em> or<em> .key </em>file extension). Since we can directly install PEM format certificates without needing to convert them, sending the certificate in this format allows us to complete the setup process faster.</p>\n<h3>Sending the SSL Certificate Securely</h3>\n<p>Because the SSL certificate is sensitive, you should use a secure method to send it to us. We recommend using a secure file sharing service to create a single-use download link that self-destructs once the file is downloaded. We like to use <a href=\"https://securesha.re/\">Secureshar.re</a>, but if you prefer another service, you are welcome to use that instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Please make sure to include the following when sending your SSL certificate with Uberflip:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>SSL certificate</strong> file: This is the certificate itself, i.e. the PEM file (or similar).</li>\n<li>The <strong>private key</strong>: This is the encryption/decryption key required to use the certificate, and is generally a separate file (if you're not sure where to find your private key, see <a href=\"https://www.digicert.com/blog/where-is-your-private-key/\">this article</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For additional security, we recommend sending these files to Uberflip separately.</p>\n<p>When you have generated secure download links for these files, please email them to <em>support@uberflip.com</em>. As soon as your certificate has been installed and your SSL setup completed, we will notify you by email.</p>"

This is happening because we're transitioning to a new image management system platform-wide. For more information, check out: <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/20903973796365\">The Image Migrator app is being retired [2024]</a></p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_b61f1927-db66-4d68-9b3b-b74794c4347b\">Before you begin</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Before you can use the Image Migrator app, you need to install it from the Uberflip Marketplace (click on <strong>Marketplace</strong> in the top navigation in Uberflip).</li>\n<li>To use Image Migrator, your Uberflip account must have <strong>API access</strong>. This feature is included with certain pack types, or may be added on to your Uberflip subscription. For more information, please speak with your Uberflip account representative.</li>\n<li>You will also need your Uberflip account's <strong>API Key and API Secret </strong>as well as its <strong>Account ID</strong>. To learn where to get these details, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019084031\">this article</a>.</li>\n<li>To work with the Image Migrator app,<strong> images you want to migrate</strong> <strong>must meet the following requirements</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>All images must be available on the web through<strong> publicly accessible URLs </strong>(can't be behind a login).</li>\n<li>Every image must have <strong>its own URL </strong>that points directly to the image file (i.e. URLs can't point to non-image files or compressed/zip files of image files).</li>\n<li>All image URLs must be <strong>active</strong> (i.e. successfully loads the image, not a 404 error) at the time of migration. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HE8SMPACC6CT5W4698K2QH0Z\">About Image Migrator</h2>\n<p>The<strong> Image Migrator</strong> app allows you to move blog images in bulk from an external host (e.g. a CMS) into Uberflip.</p>\n<p>When you <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025342851\" target=\"_self\">import an external blog into Uberflip</a>, the Uberflip platform creates an exact copy of the blog using its RSS feed. The problem: images in the blog are represented by the URLs where the images are hosted, and these external image URLs are also copied directly into Uberflip. As a result, all images in the Uberflip copy of the blog will still be loaded from their external URLs, so if those URLs become inaccessible (e.g. because the original blog goes offline), the images will break.</p>\n<p>If you're planning to decommission an external blog that you've imported into Uberflip, <strong>the Image Migrator app helps you to avoid broken images by moving them from the original hosting platform to Uberflip image hosting</strong>. The app automates the entire migration process, including:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Downloading blog images of your choice from their original URLs</li>\n<li>Uploading the images to the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020277571\" target=\"_self\">Uberflip Image Manager</a> in a specified Hub</li>\n<li>Identifying all the Items in that Hub where the images appear</li>\n<li>Replacing the external image URLs in these Items with the equivalent Uberflip-hosted URL</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have successfully migrated the images to Uberflip, you can safely shut down the external blog without breaking the images in the Uberflip Blog Stream.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01ECQJ4TT77AKPQ3K268F37YC6\">Configuring the app</h2>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HE8SMPACSJSXS93BVXJNYPTC\" class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>You configure this app at the <strong>Hub level</strong>, which means that your settings will apply only to the Hub you are currently working in. If you have multiple Hubs, you must configure (and use) this app separately in each Hub.</p>\n</div>\n<p>After your Customer Success Manager has installed the Image Migrator app on your Uberflip account, you'll need to start by <strong>configuring it with your Uberflip API credentials</strong>. The Image Migrator app will use these credentials to access your Uberflip account via the API to upload and replace images.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip and click on <strong>Hubs</strong> in the menu at the top, then <strong>click on the Hub</strong> you want to work with.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Image Migrator:</strong><br>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360049036771\" alt=\"Hubs___Image_Migrator_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Image Migrations</strong> interface will appear on the right.

If you are looking to implement the site-wide Insight Tag from LinkedIn, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a418880/add-the-linkedin-insight-tag-to-your-website?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">see this article for instructions</a>. Implementing this Insight Tag is <strong>required</strong> to perform any type of conversion tracking with LinkedIn.</span></p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_8f4d1581-ad00-48df-8bd1-807c14923c6e\">Prerequisite: Setup Conversion Tracking Campaign in Manager</h2>\n<p>Before you can implement the tracking code on your Uberflip Hub, you'll need to create an <strong>Insight tag, event-specific </strong>tracking method conversion in LinkedIn Campaign Manager. To do so, follow the instructions in this article from LinkedIn:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a425606\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn: Set up Online Conversion tracking</a></p>\n<p>Once you've set up your conversion using the Insight Tag, event-specific method, you should have a copy of its code snippet. It will look something like this:</p>\n<pre><span style=\"background-color: #e9ebed; font-family: monospace, monospace; font-size: 13px; white-space: pre;\">window.lintrk('track', { conversion_id: XXXXXXX });</span></pre>\n<p>Your tracking code will have a unique ID after <strong>conversion_id</strong> to associate it to your campaign.</p>\n<p>This is what it will look like in LinkedIn Campaign Manager when you are selecting the conversion method:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/9268874683789/linkedin-conversion-tracking.png\" alt=\"linkedin-conversion-tracking.png\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Set Up LinkedIn Conversion Tracking on Your Hub</h2>\n<p>Now that you have the tracking code, you can add it to your Hub using <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">custom code</a>. Follow the instructions below to set up the tracking code so that it fires when a Form CTA is submitted.</p>\n<p>Create a code block and name it anything you'd like. For the placement of the code block, select 'Body Bottom'. </p>\n<p>The basis of your code block will be the following:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;<br>window.addEventListener('uberflip.ctaFormSubmitSuccess', (ctaId, ctaData, ctaName) =&gt; {<br>    window.lintrk('track', { conversion_id: XXXXXXX });<br>});<br>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>You'll need to swap out the <strong>conversion_id</strong> with the ID from the conversion campaign you setup in Campaign Manager.</p>\n<p>Now all you have to do is save and enable your code block, and your Linkedin tracking pixel will be deployed on your Hub.</p>\n<h3>Form Specific Conversion Tracking</h3>\n<p>The instructions above would trigger the conversion tracking on <strong>all Form CTA submissions</strong> in a Hub. If you'd like to narrow it down to a specific form, the same steps can be taken but using the following code snippet instead:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;<br>window.addEventListener('uberflip.ctaFormSubmitSuccess', (ctaId, ctaData, ctaName) =&gt; {<br>    if (ctaId.detail.caller.dataset.id == [INSERT FORM CTA ID) {<br>       window.lintrk('track', { conversion_id: XXXXXXX });<br>    }<br>});<br>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>You'll still swap out your <strong>conversion_id</strong> with the ID from your event in LinkedIn Campaign Manager. Where it says <strong>[INSERT FORM CTA ID] </strong>you will include the ID of the Uberflip Form CTA you want to trigger this conversion on. The Form CTA ID can be found in Uberflip by navigating to <strong>Calls-To-Action &gt; Form Calls-To-Action </strong>and finding your CTA. There will be a <strong>CTA ID</strong> column in the table that denotes its unique ID.</p>\n<h3>Item Specific Conversion Tracking</h3>\n<p>If you'd like to trigger the conversion on a specific gated Item in your Hub, the same code snippet for firing on all Form CTAs can be used. The only difference is that you'd create the snippet in an <strong>Item-level code block</strong>. For instructions on setting this up, see the Item-Level Custom Code Blocks section in <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this article</a>.</p>"

See <a href=\"#h_7029dd6a-9ae9-4ac5-86ae-e1671bdcbea0\" target=\"_self\">our explanation below</a> for more information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_7029dd6a-9ae9-4ac5-86ae-e1671bdcbea0\">About Pocket</h2>\n<p>Pocket is a free tool that allows you to \"clip\" content like blog posts, articles, etc., and save them to your Pocket account. A Pocket account also includes an RSS feed that aggregates all the content you save, which opens up an interesting use case with Uberflip: by setting up a Blog Stream in your Hub that draws on this RSS feed, you can automatically populate the Stream with any Item you add to your Pocket account.</p>\n<p>By doing this, you are able to quickly and easily curate a Stream of external content. Basically, whenever you see some web content you want to include in your Stream, all you have to do is click the <em>Save to Pocket</em> button to automatically add it to the Stream.</p>\n<p>Before we go any further, it's very important to note that <strong>the method described in this article is not suitable for most Hubs</strong>. Before using it, please read on to understand its limitations and how this affects your Hub.</p>\n<h3>Limitations</h3>\n<p>The most effective content experiences keep visitors engaging with your content for as long as possible, which means keeping visitors in your Hub. The problem is, this method does the opposite: it creates Streams that will encourage visitors to <strong>exit your Hub</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here's why: when you save an article to Pocket, its full contents is <strong>not</strong> included in your Pocket RSS feed. Instead, Pocket will only include a snippet of the article, along with the canonical URL for the content (i.e. a link back to the website where it originally appeared). As a result, any Item in your Hub that is created from the Pocket RSS feed will only show partial content, so visitors who want to view it in full must go the original website — taking them out of your Hub.</p>\n<h3>Should I Do This?</h3>\n<p>The most important thing to know about this method is that using it <em>will</em> create Streams that take visitors out of your Hub. This is an inherent aspect of the method, so you should proceed only if you accept that this will happen, and ideally <em>want</em> it to happen as part of your particular use case.</p>\n<p>Since there are not many use cases where you want visitors to leave your Hub, we do not recommend this method for most Hubs. We recommend using it only if your particular use case fits these basic criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You want to create a Stream that consists entirely of <strong>external</strong> content (i.e. content produced or owned by third parties)</li>\n<li>You will routinely \"curate\" this Stream by adding new external content to it, and need an easy way to do this</li>\n<li>You want visitors who view content in this Stream to <strong>exit</strong> <strong>your Hub</strong> and view the content in its original context</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Can I use an app other than Pocket?</h4>\n<p>There are a variety of alternatives to Pocket available. The basic method described in this article should work with any similar tool that has a <strong>publicly accessible RSS feed</strong> which:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is automatically updated with newly saved items</li>\n<li>Includes the canonical URL of each Item's original location</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should be able to use any alternative tool that supports these features; however, in this article, we will focus specifically on Pocket.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Prerequisite: Get a Pocket Account &amp; Browser Extension</h2>\n<p>Before you can proceed, you'll need a Pocket account. You can sign up for free <a href=\"https://getpocket.com/signup/\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>You'll also need to get the Pocket extension for your browser, which is what you'll use to save content to add it to your Stream. If you're a Firefox user, Pocket is already built in. For other browsers, you'll need to download and install an extension. You can also save to Pocket from a variety of apps other than a browser. For more information, see <a href=\"https://getpocket.com/add/\">this page from Pocket</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you have signed up for and are logged in to your account, and you have the extension, you can proceed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Get Your Pocket RSS Feed URL</h2>\n<p>To set up a Stream for your Pocket content in your Hub, you'll need your Pocket account's RSS feed URL. To find it, see this article from Pocket:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://help.getpocket.com/article/1074-can-i-subscribe-to-my-list-via-rss\">Pocket: Can I subscribe to my list via RSS?</a></strong></p>\n<p>Once you have located the RSS feed URL, copy it, as you'll need it for the next step.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Create a new Blog Stream</h2>\n<p>Now all you have to do is set up the Blog Stream that pulls content from this RSS feed. To create the new Blog Stream, simply follow the instructions in the following article (follow the steps for <em>Import Articles from an External Blog</em>):</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025342851\" target=\"_self\">Create a Blog Stream</a></strong></p>\n<p>As you set up the new Blog Stream, keep the following in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In <strong>Step 2</strong> of <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025342851-Create-a-Blog-Stream#import-articles-from-an-external-blog\"><em>Import Articles from an External Blog</em></a>, make sure you <strong>paste in the Pocket RSS feed URL</strong> that you copied earlier.</li>\n<li>Under the setup options for the Stream, make sure you check the option for <strong>Allow small images to be used for thumbnails:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360027835752/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\"></strong>\n</li>\n<li>You can leave all other options unchecked.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Set Up Automatic Redirects</h2>\n<p>Because Pocket only saves partial content to its RSS feed, you need to set up the Stream to redirect to the original (canonical) URL whenever a visitor clicks on an Item. If you don't do this, visitors who click on an Item in the Stream will only see a snippet of the content they wanted to consume.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>After creating the Stream, click on <strong>Content</strong> in the left menu bar.</li>\n<li>On the right side, click on the <strong>Streams</strong> tab to view a list of all Streams in your Hub.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Click on the Stream</strong> that you just created (your Pocket Stream).</li>\n<li>While viewing the Stream, click on the <strong>Options</strong> tab at the top to view Stream options.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360027837192/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"707\" height=\"202\">\n</li>\n<li>Look for the option <strong>Auto redirect to Item's Canonical URL </strong>and <strong>enable it</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360027837792/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"701\" height=\"140\">\n</li>\n<li>You can leave all other options at their defaults, or customize them as you prefer.</li>\n<li>Your Stream is now set up, and you can begin populating it with content using Pocket.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Populate the Stream With Pocket</h2>\n<p>To populate your Stream, simply save Items using Pocket. Anything that you save to your Pocket account will automatically be added to its RSS feed, which will bring it into the connected Stream as a new Item. To save content to your Pocket account, simply click on the <em>Save to Pocket</em> button in your browser, which looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360027839472/What_Ice_Fishing_Taught_Me_About_ABM.png\" alt=\"What_Ice_Fishing_Taught_Me_About_ABM.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"202\"></p>\n<p>For more information about saving to Pocket, see this article:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://getpocket.com/add/\">Pocket: How to Save</a></strong></p>"

You can also change your filters at any time by simply following the instructions above again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Additional Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Persistent filters are <strong>specific to your browser</strong>: they do not apply to any other user in your Uberflip account, or if you access your account from a different browser (or in incognito mode).</li>\n<li>Persistent filter settings will be overridden by dashboard-specific filter settings, i.e. any filters set using the on-dashboard controls (including <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040312352\" target=\"_self\">saved dashboard filters</a>).</li>\n<li>Because they are saved to your browser cache, any persistent filters you configure will be <strong>lost if you clear your browser cache</strong>.</li>\n<li>Currently, the only type of persistent filter available in Uberflip Analytics is the <strong>View Date</strong> filter.

By default, these tags are only displayed in the Uberflip app, and are not included when an Item is viewed in the Hub's front end. To make these tags available to app like Bombora Personalizer, you must enable the setting <strong>Include Item tags for Custom Code</strong><em>. </em></p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>This setting is Hub-specific, so you must <strong>enable it separately in each Hub</strong> where you want to use Bombora Personalizer.</p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Uberflip account and use the <strong>Hubs</strong> menu to select the Hub where you want to enable the setting.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Hub Options &gt; Advanced</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under the section <strong>Content Experience</strong>, check the box next to <strong>Include Item tags for Custom Code</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/4410710039693/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The change will be saved automatically, and will take effect immediately.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Configuring the Bombora Personalizer app</h2>\n<p>To use Bombora Personalizer in your Uberflip account, configure the app's settings. These settings control the app's functionality, and how it is applied to your Hubs and Streams.</p>\n<p>You can configure settings for Bombora Personalizer at the <strong>Account Level</strong>, the <strong>Hub Level</strong>, the <strong>Stream Level</strong>, or all three:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any settings you configure at the <strong>Account Level</strong> will apply to <strong>all Hubs</strong> in your account.</li>\n<li>Any settings you configure at the <strong>Hub Level</strong> will apply to <strong>that Hub only</strong>. If you have also configured Account Level settings, Hub Level settings will override them for that specific Hub.</li>\n<li>Any settings you configure at the <strong>Stream Level</strong> will apply to <strong>that Stream</strong> <strong>only</strong>. If you have also configured Account and/or Hub Level settings, Stream Level settings will override them for that specific Stream.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of this app's settings can only be configured at certain levels.

For example, if a visitor's Bombora data indicates that their <em>Predictive Category</em> is set to <em>CRM &amp; Marketing Automation</em>, then the Stream will be filtered to show Items that you have tagged as relating to the CRM &amp; Marketing Automation category.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order for this functionality to work, you must set up Bombora <strong>Attribute</strong> <strong>Tags</strong> in your Uberflip account, and add them to all Items in Streams where Bombora Personalizer is active. See <a href=\"#h_01FH974BGCW2JDEKJTHBSWCQMT\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Using Attribute Tags</a> for more information.</li>\n<li>When <em>Filter Items by Tags</em> is enabled, an Item must have at least one Attribute Tag matching <em>any </em>attribute in the visitor's Bombora data to be displayed. Items that do not have at least one matching Attribute Tag (or which have no Attribute Tags) will not be displayed.</li>\n<li>If an Item has multiple Attribute Tags, only one of these tags needs to match the visitor's data for that Item to be displayed.</li>\n<li>By default, the minimum number of matching Items that will be displayed is one. If no Items in a Stream have Attribute Tags that match the visitor's Bombora data, <strong>all</strong> Items in the Stream will be shown (to avoid showing the visitor an empty Stream).<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Using the <a href=\"#h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Show Always Tag</a> changes this behavior. If you use the Show Always Tag, then only Items that have the Show Always Tag will be displayed in this situation (rather than all Items in the Stream).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When a Stream is filtered, the order in which the Items are shown will still be the same as in the original (unfiltered) Stream, except with the filtered Items hidden. For example, if five Items in a Stream are in the order 1-2-3-4-5 and Items 1 and 4 are filtered out, the Stream will still display the remaining Items in the order 2-3-5.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>If you want to use <em>Filter Items by Tags</em>, it's not necessary to tag all the Items in your Hub! To get started, try tagging just the Items in the Streams where this app is enabled.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h_01FH974BGCW2JDEKJTHBSWCQMT\">Using Attribute Tags</h4>\n<p>To use the <strong><a href=\"#h_01FH95ZQRMZVX0F46Q0CHWJ25D\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Filter Items by Tags</a></strong> functionality, you must add <strong>Attribute Tags</strong> to all Items that appear in Streams where Bombora Personalizer is enabled. Attribute Tags are specially-formatted tags which you use to indicate to Bombora Personalizer which content Items should be displayed if a visitor has a given attribute in their Bombora data.</p>\n<p>To apply an Attribute Tag to an Item, simply add it to the Item in the same way as a normal Item Tag (see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\">Use Tags on your Items</a> for instructions)<a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029638391\" target=\"_self\">.</a> Attribute Tags use the following structure:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">bombora.[attribute].[value]</code></p>\n<p>Within this basic format, replace <code class=\"no-padding\">[attribute]</code> with the Bombora attribute, and <code class=\"no-padding\">[value]</code>with the attribute’s desired value. For example, the tag <code class=\"no-padding\">bombora.pc.Accounting</code> would indicate that the tagged Item should be displayed if a visitor’s Bombora <em>Predictive Category</em> (pc) is set to \"<em>Accounting</em>\" and would therefore be applied to Items relevant to that topic.</p>\n<p>Note that values in tag names must match Bombora values <strong>exactly</strong>: any spaces, parentheses, etc. that exist in the Bombora value must also exist in the tag. See <a href=\"#h_5e1560bd-de49-40d9-a316-2d0da8102379\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Available Bombora Attributes</strong></a> below for a list of Bombora attributes and example values.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_be354b53-4bfb-4cc4-a1a1-17c1a01f1ba7\">Using the Show Always Tag</h4>\n<p>You can choose to always display certain Items, regardless of the visitor's Bombora data. To do this, use the <strong>Show Always Tag</strong>:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">bombora.show</code></p>\n<p>This tag is created automatically when you install Bombora Personalizer. To use it, simply add it to any Items that you want to always be displayed in Streams where Bombora Personalizer is active (provided the Item has been added to the Stream). This is useful for content that is relevant to a very wide audience and should be shown to all visitors, as well as to avoid instances where only one or two Items would be shown in the Stream based on Attribute Tags alone.</p>\n<p>If you use the Show Always Tag, keep in mind that the filtered Stream will still respect the Item order set for the full Stream. As a result, we recommend placing Items with the Show Always Tag either at the beginning or end of the Stream (depending on the content).</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>Do not delete the Show Always Tag from your Uberflip account, even if you don't use it on any Items! Bombora Personalizer requires this tag to be present to enable key app functionality.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>This app filters not just Items on the main Stream page, but also the additional Items displayed when viewing an Item in that Stream. While viewing an Item, the <em>Next/Previous Item</em> area and the <em>Other Content in This Stream</em> carousel will be filtered in the same way as the main Stream page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the carousel, filtered Items will take priority, and any additional free slots in the carousel (after all filtered Items have been displayed) will be filled with non-filtered Items from the same Stream</li>\n<li>If no next or previous filtered Item is available, the <em>Next/Previous Item</em> area will be hidden</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_1de240a4-6c3c-42e3-937a-69dedf2776ed\">Swap Logo</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level | Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> This setting is used to control Bombora Personalizer's dynamic logo functionality.</p>\n<p>When this setting is turned on, the app will use a visitor's Bombora data to search <a href=\"https://clearbit.com/logo\">Clearbit</a> for the logo of the visitor's organization.

We recommend using a generic logo for this purpose (e.g. a logo that just says \"You\" or similar).</p>\n<p>We also recommend specifying a default <em>Banner Title</em> under the <em>Appearance </em>tab to be displayed in case no logo is found and the logos are hidden from the banner. If you do not specify a <em>Banner Title</em>, only a blank header (or <em>Banner Image</em>, if specified) will be shown.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_0bf8cc97-cb9e-49a8-87e4-770931c95098\">Remove Logos When No Match Found</h3>\n<p><strong>Available at: <span class=\"text-warning\">Account Level | Hub Level | Stream Level</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">Optional</span> (enabled by default if you have turned on the <a href=\"#h_1de240a4-6c3c-42e3-937a-69dedf2776ed\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Swap Logo</a> setting).

These fields are used to populate the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612952\" target=\"_self\">Open Graph and Twitter Card tags</a> that social platforms use to generate link previews, and any text you put in them will appear in the preview — including the placeholder text itself, e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\">{bombora.ind}</code> instead of the relevant industry.</li>\n<li>For Marketing and Sales Streams, we recommend enabling the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020637332-Personalize-a-Marketing-or-Sales-Stream\"><strong>Banner+Logo template</strong></a> under the Stream's <em>Appearance</em> tab, as this will allow you to use the <a href=\"#h_1de240a4-6c3c-42e3-937a-69dedf2776ed\" target=\"_self\"><em>Swap Logo</em></a> setting. If you select this template, you should also enable the <strong>Hide Stream Title</strong> option and specify a <strong>Banner Title</strong> (also under the <em>Appearance</em> tab). There are two benefits to doing this:\n<ul>\n<li>If the <a href=\"#h_0bf8cc97-cb9e-49a8-87e4-770931c95098\" target=\"_self\"><em>Remove Logos When No Match Found</em></a> option is turned on and no logo matches are found, the Banner Title will be shown on the banner instead (rather than an empty banner image).</li>\n<li>If you intend to share the Stream on social media, you can put a placeholder in the Banner Title field (as this isn't shown in the social media preview), but not in the regular Stream Title field (which is shown on social media). In other words, this allows you to personalize the title that a visitor to the Stream sees, without the placeholder text appearing when the same Stream is shared on a social media platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For all Streams and Items that you don't plan to share on social media, but which you expect to be indexed by Google, we recommend using the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021612892\" target=\"_self\"><strong>SEO Title and SEO Description fields</strong></a>. These allow you to specify alternative titles and descriptions for your Streams and Items when they appear on Google search result pages. You can use these fields to ensure that any placeholders you put in a Stream's or Item's title/description do not appear when that Stream or Item appears on Google.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If you experience problems with this app's functionality, this may be due to corrupted data. To resolve the issue, try clearing your browser's cache (or try using the app in Incognito Mode to see if that resolves the issue).</li>\n<li>If you have custom code in your Hub that isn't working properly when using the Bombora app, please <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\" target=\"_self\">reach out to Uberflip onBrand support</a>. They can help get this fixed for you. </li>\n</ul>"

If you're not sure whether your plan includes API access, please contact your Brightcove representative for help.</li>\n<li>You can only connect your Hub to one Brightcove instance at a time (a Brightcove instance may contain multiple accounts, but they must all be accessible under the same login credentials).</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About the Brightcove Integration</h2>\n<p>Brightcove Video Cloud is a video hosting platform. If you're already hosting your video content on Brightcove, you can easily make it part of your content experiences by bringing it into your Hub with our Brightcove integration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_efca44e5-cfad-4c34-a33b-680b83acd4e1\">Prerequisite: Get Your Brightcove API Credentials</h2>\n<p>To pull your Brightcove videos into your Hub, Uberflip will access your account using the Brightcove API. To do this, we will need <strong>API credentials</strong>. You can get these from your Brightcove account, and use them to give third party services access to your account without having to share your login credentials.</p>\n<p>Specifically, you will need to get the following credentials from your Brightcove account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Account Number</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Client ID</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Client Secret</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 1: Get Your Account Number</h3>\n<p>The first thing you'll need is your Brightcove account number, which is also referred to as your <strong>Account ID</strong>. It is readily available your Brightcove account. For detailed instructions on where to find it, see <strong>Steps 1 and 2</strong> in this article from Brightcove:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://studio.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-account-information.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brightcove: Get Client Credentials</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Step 2: Get Your Client ID and Client Secret</h3>\n<p>To get your <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong>, you'll need to <strong>register a</strong> <strong>client</strong> in Brightcove. In this context, Uberflip is the \"client\", and registering a client for Uberflip effectively creates a special kind of user in your Brightcove account. Uberflip's integration will use this client to access your Brightcove account and pull your videos into your Hub.</p>\n<p>As with a regular user in your account, you will choose which permissions the client will have within your account. At the end of the setup process, Brightcove will generate a <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong> for the newly created client, which are essentially analogous to a username and password. You will use these to set up the integration in Uberflip.</p>\n<p>You can find detailed instructions on how to register a client in this article from Brightcove:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://apis.support.brightcove.com/general/managing-api-authentication-credentials.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brightcove: Creating client registrations</a></strong></p>\n<p>As you follow the steps in that article, keep the following notes in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 4: </strong>You can choose any name and description you like, but for ease of use in the future, we recommend indicating that this is the client you use for the Uberflip integration.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 5: </strong>Make sure you select all of the accounts that contain videos you want to bring into your Hub.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 6: </strong>The only permissions you need to grant to the client are <strong>CMS &gt; </strong><strong>Playlist Read</strong> and <strong>CMS &gt;</strong> <strong>Video</strong> <strong>Read</strong>, as well as <strong>Players &gt;</strong> <strong>Read</strong>. Ensure that the boxes next to these three permissions are checked. You can leave all other permissions unchecked.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 8: </strong>In this step, you'll get the <strong>Client ID and Client Secret</strong> that you'll need to proceed. Make sure you copy these and paste them somewhere where you can easily retrieve them in a moment (for example, a text editor like Notepad/TextEdit). As soon as you click on the <strong>Okay, I copied it</strong> button, these details will no longer be accessible — if you didn't copy them, would have to generate new ones by creating a new client registration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you have your <strong>Account Number</strong>, <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong>, proceed below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Create a Brightcove Stream</h2>\n<p>All you have to do to connect your Hub to Brightcove and pull in your videos is create a new Brightcove Stream. Once you have created a Brightcove Stream, it will remain connected to your Brightcove account, and will continue to pull in any new content you publish there automatically.</p>\n<p>Each Brightcove Stream you create will pull in videos from one playlist within one Brightcove player. You can pull in videos from multiple Brightcove playlists by simply creating multiple Brightcove Streams in your Hub.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip and navigate to the Hub where you want to add the Brightcove Stream.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu, click <strong>Content</strong>\n</li>\n<li>On the<strong> Content</strong>, you'll be on the <em><strong>Streams</strong></em> tab.

You can usually obtain this information from your IT department.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HRDBCVA2KFZ905RG6QHKMQ6H\">About IP Address Exclusion</h2>\n<p>In most organizations, it's common for internal users to spend a lot of time browsing their own Hubs: aside from Marketing reviewing the content they create, Sales and Success teams will also routinely browse for content to share.</p>\n<p>The problem is, all of this internal traffic throws off your metrics: your internal users tend to have different browsing habits from your external visitors, which can <strong>skew the data and make your metrics unreliable</strong>. To avoid this, you should set up Uberflip Analytics to filter out your organization's own IP addresses, which will exclude any data generated by internal visitors.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HRDBCVA2GETGG3MV8JY6WY98\" class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>Do you <strong>work from home</strong>? Don't forget to <strong>add your own home IP address</strong> (and those of any coworkers who also work remotely) to your list of exclusions. (If you're not sure what your home IP address, simply Google \"what is my IP?\".)</p>\n<p>If you do this, keep in mind that most home IP addresses aren't static, and may change from time to time.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HRDBCVA2C3N99B79KXJ9C78K\">Exclude Specific IP Addresses from Uberflip Analytics</h2>\n<p>You can specify any individual IP address or range of IP addresses to be excluded. The specified IP addresses must be <strong>IPv4</strong> (IPv6 addresses are not supported), and can be added as <strong>single IP addresses</strong>, <strong>IP ranges</strong>, or <strong>CIDRs</strong>.</p>\n<p>Any exclusions you specify will apply to both Uberflip Analytics <strong>and</strong> legacy Metrics. The exclusion rules work differently for each system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>In Uberflip Analytics</strong>: IP address filters will be applied to future data only. Filters are <strong>non-destructive</strong> (filtered data is hidden, not deleted).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>In legacy Metrics</strong>: IP address filters are applied <strong>only</strong> to future data, i.e. after an exclusion is added. Any previously collected data relating to an excluded IP address will not be removed from your existing metrics. Filters are <strong>destructive</strong> (filtered data is deleted, and not recoverable).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To exclude IP addresses from Uberflip Analytics (and legacy Metrics):</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip and click on <strong>Analytics</strong> in the top menu.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Analytics Settings</strong>, then click on <strong>Exclude IP Addresses</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360048495771\" alt=\"image.png\" width=\"244\" height=\"157\">\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Exclude IP Addresses</strong> menu will appear on the right. Use the <strong>IP Addresses</strong> text box to type in any IP address(es) that you want to exclude from Uberflip Analytics data.<br>\n<ul>\n<li>See the help text above the text box for accepted formats.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360048373892\" alt=\"Excluded_IP_Addresses_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When you are finished, click on <strong>Save</strong>. Your settings will take effect immediately.</li>\n<li>If you later want to remove an IP address exclusion (i.e. to stop filtering out traffic for a certain IP address/range), simply <strong>remove it from the list</strong>, then click on <strong>Save</strong> again.\n<ul>\n<li>For <strong>Uberflip Analytics</strong>: Data for previously filtered IP addresses will be visible again, including for the period when the exclusion was in effect.</li>\n<li>For <strong>legacy Metrics</strong>: Data for previously filtered IP addresses will only be visible for the period after the exclusion was removed (and before the exclusion was added). Data for the period when the exclusion was in effect was not collected, and is not available.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HRDBCVA2W2VPAVWQRFWBB36S\">Excluded Visitors Dashboard</h2>\n<p>Because Uberflip Analytics filters out data for excluded IP addresses without destroying it, this data is still collected and remains available. The <strong>Excluded Visitors</strong> dashboard, which is located below the <em>Exclude IP Addresses</em> menu, displays metrics for <strong>only the IP addresses specified in your exclusion list</strong>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360048374572\" alt=\"Excluded_IP_Addresses_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>This dashboard essentially shows the effects of the exclusion rules you have set up. As a result, it's useful for <strong>testing if the exclusions you have configured are having the intended effect</strong>.</p>"

If you're not sure whether your plan includes API access, please contact your Vidyard representative for help.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About the Vidyard Integration</h2>\n<p>Vidyard is a video hosting platform specifically tailored to Marketing and Sales use cases. If you're already hosting your video content on Vidyard, you can easily make it part of your content experiences by bringing it into your Hub with our Vidyard integration.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Vidyard plans with a limited number of embeds</h4>\n<p>This integration <strong>embeds</strong> videos from your Vidyard account into pages on your Uberflip Hub. Some Vidyard plans have a <strong>limit on the number of videos that you can embed</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you are on this type of plan, you must ensure that any Vidyard videos that you bring into your Hub are <strong>set to be embeddable in Vidyard</strong>, otherwise visitors will encounter an error when trying to view them.</p>\n<p>For more information and instructions, see this article from Vidyard:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://knowledge.vidyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033244534\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\"><strong>Vidyard: Why is my video no longer available at its embedded location?</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_efca44e5-cfad-4c34-a33b-680b83acd4e1\">Prerequisite: Get Your Vidyard API Token</h2>\n<p>To pull your Vidyard players into your Hub, Uberflip will access your Vidyard account using the Vidyard API. To do that, we'll need an <strong>API token</strong>. You use API tokens to give third party services access to your Vidyard account without needing to share your login credentials.</p>\n<p>In Vidyard, API tokens are specific to a <strong>sub-group </strong>and the players it contains. Vidyard controls access to a sub-group using <strong>roles</strong>, and each role has its own API token. You can use any default or custom role's API token with Uberflip, provided that the role has the <strong>View Organizations Assets</strong> permission enabled. If you would like to simply use a default system role's API token, choose the token belonging to the <strong>User</strong> role.</p>\n<p>Once you have chosen the role you want to use, simply <strong>copy its API token </strong>in Vidyard.</p>\n<p>To learn where you can find and copy the API token you'll need, see this article from Vidyard:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://knowledge.vidyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009875814-Access-your-Vidyard-API-tokens\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Vidyard: Access your Vidyard API tokens</strong></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Create a Vidyard Stream</h2>\n<p>All you have to do to connect your Uberflip account to Vidyard and pull in all available players is create a new Vidyard Stream. Once you have created a Vidyard Stream, it will remain connected to your Vidyard account, and will continue to pull in any new content you publish there automatically.</p>\n<p>Each time you create a new Vidyard Stream in your Hub, you'll be asked to enter an API token. This means you can create separate Vidyard Streams with different API tokens, for example if you need to import players from multiple Vidyard sub-groups.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note: Vidyard player and Video Structure</h4>\n<p>Vidyard organizes video content in the following way: <em>Parent group &gt; sub-group &gt; player &gt; individual videos</em>. In other words, a Parent group can contain multiple sub-groups, and each sub-group can contain multiple players, which in turn can contain multiple videos.</p>\n<p>Uberflip imports <strong>all players from a specified sub-group</strong>. Note that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API tokens are specific to a single sub-group, so adding a new Stream <strong>will only import players from the sub-group associated with the API token</strong> you provided. You would need to add additional Streams to import players in other sub-groups (using separate API tokens).</li>\n<li>Uberflip will create <strong>one Item per player</strong>. If a player contains multiple videos, they will all be contained within the one Item representing that player.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip and navigate to the Hub where you want to add the Vidyard Stream</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu, click <strong>Content</strong>\n</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Streams</strong> tab of the Content page, click the <strong>New Stream</strong> button<br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/8690833526925/abcd.png\" alt=\"abcd.png\"></span>\n</li>\n<li>In the modal that opens, select <strong>Vidyard</strong> in the <em>Source Streams</em> list<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/12918299957901\" alt=\"mceclip0.png\" width=\"401\" height=\"403\">\n</li>\n<li>You'll now see the <strong>Add a Vidyard Stream</strong> window.

To learn more about Uberflip Analytics and how to use it, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035433571\" target=\"_self\">this article</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About Data Collection Start Dates</h2>\n<p>Uberflip Analytics is powered by a proprietary event collection system. As visitors browse Uberflip Hubs, this system records a variety of events related to their behavior. The collected data is then fed into Uberflip Analytics, where it is used to calculate the metrics that are displayed.</p>\n<p>When it was originally launched, the event collection system was able to collect a limited number of data points, and we have since implemented the collection of additional data points on an ongoing basis. As a result, the various data points collected by the system have <strong>distinct start dates</strong> on which Uberflip Analytics began to collect the relevant data. In practice, this means that different metrics in Uberflip Analytics have varying amounts of historical data available, so you can view data further back in time on some metrics than on others.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Uberflip Analytics Data Collection Start Dates</h2>\n<p>The table below displays the start dates on which Uberflip Analytics first began to collect data for each category of metrics that it records:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>Start Date</em> column indicates the <strong>first full month</strong> in which data was collected. In some cases, data for part of the previous month may also be available, but would represent an incomplete view of that month.</li>\n<li>Where applicable, the <em>Notes </em>column lists any exceptions to the start date indicated, or any other related issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<table style=\"height: 1183px;\" width=\"688\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 22px;\">\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 218px;

You can see an example of this in <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023372611\" target=\"_self\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p>If you intend to integrate Disqus with your Hub, we strongly recommend doing so <strong>only with a paid Disqus account</strong> (Plus or Pro).</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About the Disqus Integration</h2>\n<p>Disqus is a service that lets you add commenting functionality to any of your web properties, including your Hub. This allows you to engage directly with your visitors and prospects, and build a community around your brand and content:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360025652971/Features_-_Engage_Your_Audience.png\" alt=\"Features_-_Engage_Your_Audience.png\" width=\"616\" height=\"396\"></p>\n<p>To learn more about Disqus and its features, check out the <a href=\"https://disqus.com/features/engage/\">Disqus website</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Prerequisite: Get Your Disqus Shortname</h2>\n<p>To use Disqus with your Hub, you will need to register for a Disqus account (if you don't already have one), then add your Hub to the account by <strong>creating a new site</strong> <strong>in Disqus</strong>. You can go straight to the Disqus <em>Create a new site</em> page by signing in on this page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://disqus.com/admin/create/\">https://disqus.com/admin/create/</a></p>\n<p>As part of creating your Hub as a new site in your Disqus account, you will also create a <strong>shortname</strong>, which is the unique identifier for your site in Disqus. It is automatically generated for you when you enter a Website Name during the site creation process in Disqus:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360025645892/Register_Site_-_Disqus_Admin.png\" alt=\"Register_Site_-_Disqus_Admin.png\"></p>\n<p>The shortname is important, as you will need it to set up the integration.

Simply click on <strong>Analytics</strong> in the topbar menu:<br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/22893154240397\" alt=\"mceclip0.png\" width=\"595\" height=\"72\"></span></p>\n<p>Uberflip Analytics always opens to the <strong>Home dashboard</strong>, which provides a high-level overview of key performance data across <strong>all Hubs in your account</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z05Y1M3YSVDAQPNDHD\">Navigate Uberflip Analytics</h2>\n<p>To get around UFA, use the <strong>sidebar menu</strong>. From this menu, you can navigate to the various <strong>dashboards </strong>and <strong>reports </strong>available in UFA, as well as UFA's <strong>settings</strong>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360084129312\" alt=\"image2.png\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z0Z1AJ7G3VSAMDK8PV\">Dashboards</h3>\n<p><strong>Dashboards</strong> are the focal point of the Uberflip Analytics interface. These are collections of data visualizations (\"widgets\") that focus on particular areas of interest, such as how visitors are reaching your Hubs, or how your Form CTAs are performing.</p>\n<p>In addition to the general <strong>Home</strong> dashboard, UFA offers a variety of more granular and specialized dashboards. These are grouped into four <strong>categories </strong>based on the type of data they focus on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Traffic</strong>: Where your visitors are coming from</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content</strong>: How content and content experiences are performing</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Calls-To-Action</strong>: How your CTAs are performing</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Visitors</strong>: How visitors are behaving once they are in your Hubs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These categories are shown as sections the sidebar menu: <strong>click on any category</strong><strong> to expand it</strong> and navigate to the dashboards inside.</p>\n<p>All dashboards can be <strong>filtered</strong>, and you can <strong>export data</strong> from dashboards — we'll look at these actions in more detail below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z0H8EE9NFX55PPFR60\">Reports</h3>\n<p>Where dashboards visualize data to make it more easily digestible, <strong>reports</strong> display the underlying <strong>raw data</strong> in table form. Reports are more comprehensive than dashboards, allowing you to dive into the data in much greater detail.</p>\n<p>UFA features a number of built-in reports. To view them, <strong>click on the <em>Standard Reports</em> section</strong> in the sidebar to expand it.</p>\n<p>Like dashboards, reports also allow for <strong>filtering </strong>and <strong>data exports</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z003YYASJ6MGN0PHH0\" class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>Because they can contain a large amount of data, it's normal for reports to take a little longer to load than dashboards.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z0EY3ATX89ACFXX2Z7\">Settings</h3>\n<p>Use UFA's settings to customize it to your organization's needs. See these articles for more details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039250291\" target=\"_self\">Exclude Traffic From Specific IP Addresses in Uberflip Analytics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039658671\" target=\"_self\">Set Persistent Filters in Uberflip Analytics</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z0VDZAJAAPMXAMKM1C\">Basic Uberflip Analytics features</h2>\n<p>While viewing dashboards and reports in UFA, you can <strong>refresh the data </strong>at any time, as well as <strong>learn how specific data points are defined or calculated.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z0QS7TVY6G5XTPRAJZ\">Refresh data</h3>\n<p>Uberflip Analytics <strong>automatically displays the most up-to-date data</strong> available. Here's how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you open a dashboard, the <strong>most recent available</strong> data will be displayed. In most cases this will initially be <strong>cached data</strong> from the last time a refresh occurred. You can see how recent the cached data is in the top right corner:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043188591\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>As part of loading a dashboard, Uberflip Analytics also <strong>checks if more recent</strong> <strong>data</strong> is available. If there is more recent data, this is <strong>compared to the cached data</strong>. If this comparison finds a difference, Uberflip Analytics will <strong>automatically start loading the latest data </strong>into the dashboard widget. This is indicated by a <strong>loading spinner </strong>that appears in the top right corner of each widget:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043295011\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-11-18__12_11_PM.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Once the <strong>latest data is being displayed across all widgets</strong>, the timestamp in the top right corner of the page will display \"<em>just now</em>\" to reflect this:<strong><br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043254092\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\"></strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition to the automatic check that happens when you load a dashboard, you can also <strong>force a check for more recent data</strong>. To do so, simply <strong>click the <em>Run</em> button</strong>. You can do this at any time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is <strong>no difference</strong> between the cached data and the more recently collected data, <strong>the dashboard will not update even if you force a refresh</strong> (by clicking the <em>Run</em> button). In this case, the timestamp in the top right corner will continue to reflect the last time the data was updated (i.e. the last time there was a change).</li>\n<li>Unlike dashboards,<strong> reports</strong> will <strong>always</strong> <strong>pull in the latest data </strong>when they are loaded, and never display cached data.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z0NQCQAVBZ9EEN2DGB\" class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>Currently, Uberflip Analytics takes approx. 1 hour to process and make collected data available, so the latest data is always a <strong>minimum of 1 hour old</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z1ZR7JEG6YNE61AB4Y\">Learn more about data points and visualizations</h3>\n<p>To learn more about how a data point is defined, or how a visualization works, use the built-in <strong>tooltip functionality</strong>. Throughout Uberflip Analytics, you can find tooltips in two places:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Visualizations</strong>: Dashboard visualizations where a tooltip is available have a small <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043293451\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\"> icon beside their title. Hover your mouse over this icon to view a tooltip that explains what the visualization shows:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043250292\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-11-18__11_55_AM.png\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tables</strong>: Anywhere you see a table (such as in some dashboard widgets and all reports), hover your mouse over a table header to see a definition of that data point:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043254352\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-11-18__12_47_PM.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also find more <strong>in-depth information about UFA's available data points</strong> in the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008893132-Data-dictionary\">data dictionary section</a> of Uberflip Help.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z154G49VDBMF2PS7RX\">Advanced Uberflip Analytics features</h2>\n<p>UFA also features various advanced functions that allow you to <strong>filter data </strong>in various ways; <strong>drill in to dashboards </strong>for additional detail; <strong>download, send, and schedule dashboards</strong>, and <strong>create custom reports</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z1V7QS51FQ43QKJPER\" class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>Uberflip Analytics date ranges use a <em><strong>from-until (before)</strong></em> format. This means that the data included in that date range ends at 11:59pm on the day before the final day selected.<br><strong><br>Example:</strong> A date range of 01/01/2022 - 07/01/2022, will return data from 01/01/2022 at 12:00am until 06/01/2022 at 11:59pm. </p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z1J7HNF81C7WHC96TY\">Filtering data</h3>\n<p>Every dashboard and report in Uberflip Analytics has a set of built-in filters. Use these filters to <strong>narrow down the data displayed in the visualizations</strong> in various ways, for example by timeframe, Hub, tags, etc.</p>\n<p>Filters are available on all dashboards and reports, and are shown in a panel at the top:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360043443751\" alt=\"Analytics_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>Some filters are universal and appear on all dashboards/reports (such as <em>View Date</em>), while other are contextual, and are determined by the data in the dashboard or report.</p>\n<p>To learn how to set filters in UFA, see this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055716132\">Filter data in Uberflip Analytics</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z1MGB2SJEW0CPJS6GY\">Drill into dashboards</h3>\n<p>You can drill into dashboards to <strong>view additional or contextual data.</strong> There are two ways to drill in UFA:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Visualization drill:</strong> You can drill into the underlying data for any dashboard visualization, such as large number or chart widgets.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stream and Item drill: </strong>In dashboard tables that display Streams or Items, you can drill into an individual Stream or Item to see more data about it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn how to use UFA's data drilling features, see this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055716312\">Drill into Uberflip Analytics dashboards to view more data</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z1H93GWXX606BTTNH1\">Download and send dashboards and reports</h3>\n<p>UFA can <strong>package and send dashboards </strong>so that you and others can view or use the dashboard data outside of the Uberflip Analytics interface. In UFA, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download full dashboards in <strong>PDF</strong> or <strong>CSV</strong> format</li>\n<li>Send dashboard data to various destinations <strong>on demand</strong> or <strong>on a schedule</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These features are especially useful for keeping stakeholders in your organization who don't typically use Uberflip up to date on your KPIs.</p>\n<p>To learn how to download, send, and schedule dashboards, see this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055717012\">Download and send Uberflip Analytics dashboards and reports</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HK8DA9Z1F8TMATDXFETETQ0Q\">Create custom reports (requires a compatible pack type or module)</h3>\n<p>If you're on Uberflip's Enterprise pack type, or you have added the Attribution module to your Uberflip subscription, you can use <em>UFA Explore</em> to dive into the raw data and <strong>create your own custom reports</strong>.</p>\n<p>To learn more about this powerful feature and how to use it, see this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051891272\" target=\"_self\">Create custom reports in Uberflip Analytics with Explore</a></li>\n</ul>"

For help with that, see the <a href=\"https://help.optimizely.com/\">Optimizely Knowledge Base</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About the Optimizely Integration</h2>\n<p>Optimizely is an experimentation platform that allows you optimize your digital experiences by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B testing</a> different configurations. If you have an Optimizely account, you can integrate it with your Hub to test things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which titles and headlines drive more content click-throughs?</li>\n<li>Which CTA colors drive more engagement?</li>\n<li>What kind of copy works better for your CTAs — direct or playful?</li>\n<li>Are certain types of images more effective than others?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about the Optimizely platform and what it can do, see <a href=\"https://www.optimizely.com/\">the Optimizely website</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Prerequisite: Create and Configure an Optimizely Web Project</h2>\n<p>Optimizely integrates with your Hub using a small piece of code called a <strong>snippet</strong>. Optimizely organizes your experiments into <strong>Web Projects</strong>, each of which have their own snippet. Uberflip grabs this snippet from Optimizely automatically: all you have to do is tell us the unique Project ID of the Web Project you want to use with your Hub.</p>\n<p>As a result, before you can set up the integration in Uberflip, there are three things you need to do:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new Web Project for your Hub</li>\n<li>Change a setting so that the Web Project's snippet will work with your Hub</li>\n<li>Get the Web Project's <em>Project ID</em>, which Uberflip will use to grab the snippet from Optimizely and deploy it on your Hub</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Step 1: Create a Web Project</h3>\n<p>To integrate your Hub with Optimizely, you'll need to <strong>set up a new Web Project</strong> <strong>in Optimizely</strong> that is specifically dedicated to running tests on your Hub. We don't have any special requirements for this project: with one exception (see the next step) you can name it and set it up in any way you like.</p>\n<p>You can find instructions on how to create a new Web Project in this article from Optimizely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.optimizely.com/Set_Up_Optimizely/Manage_projects_in_Optimizely_X_Web#Create_a_new_project\">Manage projects in Optimizely X Web - Create a new project</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 2: Change the Project's jQuery Setting</h3>\n<p>Once your new Web Project has been set up, you need to <strong>adjust the jQuery</strong> setting for the project's snippet. Specifically, under <strong>Settings &gt;jQuery Inclusion</strong>, you need to make sure the setting for your Uberflip Hub project is set to <strong>Do not include jQuery in project code (recommended)</strong>.</p>\n<p>For instructions on how to find and change this setting, see this article from Optimizely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.optimizely.com/Set_Up_Optimizely/Project_Settings%3A_jQuery_and_Project_JavaScript_settings_in_Optimizely_X#jQuery_settings\">Project Settings: jQuery and Project JavaScript settings in Optimizely X - jQuery settings</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_ace252b6-7574-4100-abb8-f03ed8b6078f\">Step 3: Get your Optimizely Project ID</h3>\n<p>With your new Web Project set up and configured correctly, the only thing you still need to set up the integration with your Hub is the Web Project's <strong>Project ID</strong>.</p>\n<p>The Project ID in Optimizely is part of the Web Project's snippet: the Project ID is <strong>the number right before \".js\" in the snippet URL</strong> in Optimizely.</p>\n<p>For instructions on how where to find the snippet (and its URL and Project ID), see this article from Optimizely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.optimizely.com/Set_Up_Optimizely/Implement_the_one-line_snippet_for_Optimizely_X#2._Retrieve_the_snippet\">Implement the one-line snippet for Optimizely X - Retrieve the snippet</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Connect Your Hub to Optimizely</h2>\n<p>Now all you need to do is integrate your Hub with Optimizely by connecting them via the Hub menu.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Uberflip account and select the Hub on which you want to create an integration.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Integrations</strong>.<br> <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018402791/Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>On the right, you'll see a list of services that Uberflip can integrate with. Find <strong>Optimizely</strong> in the list, then click on its <strong>Connect</strong> button on the right (under the <strong>Action</strong> column) to set up the integration:<br> <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360024072672/Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"606\" height=\"51\">\n</li>\n<li>A pop-up window will appear. <strong>Enter <a href=\"#h_ace252b6-7574-4100-abb8-f03ed8b6078f\" target=\"_self\">the Project ID you obtained earlier</a></strong> into the field provided:<br> <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360024072732/Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"473\" height=\"310\">\n</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Connect</strong>.

The Sales Activity Dashboard displays metrics around sales activity performed using these tools, and can provide you with valuable insight into how your sales enablement efforts are performing.</p>\n<p>The metrics shown on the Sales Activity Dashboard are split into four categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overview</li>\n<li>Users</li>\n<li>Streams</li>\n<li>Items</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find details about the metrics contained within each category, as well as what they mean, in the sections below.</p>\n<p>There are also two ways to filter the available metrics. Both of these filter types are global, so they affect all metrics across all categories.</p>\n<p>You can filter all metrics by date range using the selections along the top:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360022925391/Hubs___Sales_Activity_-_Uberflip_-__Private_Browsing_.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Sales_Activity_-_Uberflip_-__Private_Browsing_.png\" width=\"379\" height=\"172\"></p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>Note that <em>month</em> in each of these options refers to calendar months. For example, if today is December 18th:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>This Month:</strong> Dec. 1 - Dec. 17</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last Month:</strong> Nov. 1 - Nov. 30</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Previous 3 Months:</strong> Sept. 1 - Nov 30</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Previous 6 Months:</strong> June 1 - Nov. 30</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>In addition, you can also filter by user groups and group members to narrow your focus to specific teams or sales reps:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360022925831/Hubs___Sales_Activity_-_Uberflip_-__Private_Browsing_.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Sales_Activity_-_Uberflip_-__Private_Browsing_.png\"></p>\n<p>(When filtering by member, note that the dropdown will only show members in the currently selected group.)</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>As a best practice, we recommend creating custom user groups for each team in your sales organization (and assigning the appropriate users to each one). Doing this will allow you to easily break down metrics by team in the Sales Activity Dashboard.</p>\n<p>These groups will primarily be used for filtering in the Sales Activity Dashboard, so you don't necessarily need to align them to your actual team structure. Instead, try to think about how you'd like to be able to break down your reporting, then create the groups necessary to accommodate this. Keep in mind as well that you can put any user into multiple groups, if needed.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Overview Metrics</h2>\n<p>Four key metrics are highlighted at the top of the Sales Activity Dashboard, and are always visible.

As a result, if you integrate Bombora with a Hub where the majority of content is not in English, <strong>no Visitor Insights will be generated</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About the Bombora Integration</h2>\n<p>One of the key aspects of creating great content experiences is tailoring your content to your visitors. But figuring out how well your efforts actually match your visitors' profiles and interests can be difficult. To help you take a data-driven approach to understanding of your audience, Uberflip has partnered with Bombora to integrate their demographic, firmographic and intent data directly into your Hub.</p>\n<p>The Bombora integration powers the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022410952\">Visitor Insights dashboard</a> in Uberflip, which you can use to gauge the relevance of your content experiences to your visitors, and to guide your content development process. In addition, Bombora is also one of the components that feeds into <a href=\"https://www.uberflip.com/ai/\">Uberflip AI</a>. This is the technology that powers the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022410572\">Content Recommendations</a> and <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022595791\">Site Engager</a> features, so integrating your Hub with Bombora allows you to take advantage of Uberflip AI to personalize recommendations for your visitors.</p>\n<p>The data Bombora provides is aggregated from billions of data points per month, drawn from a deep network of data sources called the <a href=\"https://bombora.com/data/bombora-data-co-op/\">B2B Data Cooperative</a> (Data Co-op). Integrating your Hub with Bombora makes it part of the Data Co-op, giving you access to this massive pooled data set while also contributing to it. You can find more information about Bombora and how it collects data <a href=\"https://bombora.com/data/\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">What is intent data?</h4>\n<p>Intent data is information about topics visitors are interested in, focused on keywords and behavior that suggest the <em>intent</em> to make a purchase related to those topics. Bombora generates this data by observing user browsing behavior and content consumption across their network, then using machine learning to analyze keywords and identify the topics of each visited page. Given enough data, this allows Bombora to build a profile of a given visitor's interests, and to infer their intent to make a purchase.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Connect Bombora to Your Hub</h2>\n<p>All you need to do to integrate your Hub with Bombora is to connect them via the Hub menu.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Uberflip account and select the Hub on which you want to create an integration.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Integrations</strong>.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018402791/Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>On the right, you'll see a list of services that Uberflip can integrate with.

Items are account-wide, so any Item in your Uberflip account can be used in any Hub under that account.</p>\n<p>To use an Item that lives in one Hub in a different Hub, you'll need to use a <strong>Marketing Stream</strong> in the destination Hub (the Hub where you want to use the Item). Either create a new Marketing Stream, or use an existing one.</p>\n<p>Open up the Marketing Stream (in the destination Hub) by going to <em>Content &gt; Streams tab </em>and clicking on the Stream. While viewing the Marketing Stream, click on the <strong>Manage Items</strong> button in the menu bar:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360038927352/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>The <strong>Update Marketing Stream</strong> menu will appear in a pop-up window.

Within your Hubs, <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020989871\">Form CTAs</a> are a highly effective way to generate leads — <a href=\"https://hub.uberflip.com/blog/gating-content-this-one-small-change-will-7x-your-conversion-rate\">over 7x more effective than traditional landing pages</a>. And once you've generated those leads, you need to do something with them — which is where Marketing Automation Platforms (MAPs) like Pardot shine.</p>\n<p>Form CTAs are designed to stream the leads they capture to a MAP, where you can make them part of your lead nurturing strategy. With Pardot specifically, you have the option of adding these leads to your main Prospect List, or to a Pardot List of your choice.</p>\n<p>When you integrate your account with Pardot, Uberflip also automatically assigns unique IDs (using cookies) to all visitors to your Hub. This has two effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a visitor fills out a Form CTA that is connected to Pardot, the data they enter is tied to their cookie's ID. This allows us to automatically prefill that visitor's data on any other Form CTAs that they interact with.</li>\n<li>Even if a user has not yet filled out a Form CTA, the cookie allows them to be tracked as they engage with your Hub content. If you set up the necessary custom fields in Pardot, this allows you to track the Items that leads convert on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this article, we'll look at the prerequisites for integrating your account with Pardot, how to configure the integration, and optional steps to enable additional data collection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_948614204271547759391585\">Prerequisite: Get your Pardot login credentials</h2>\n<p>To set up a Pardot integration, you will need the following information:</p>\n<dl class=\"dl-horizontal\">\n<dt>Salesforce login credentials</dt>\n<dd>The email address and password associated with the Salesforce SSO account that you want to use. See the <a href=\"#h_01EXFSFM2Q1HX37428486ZR557\" target=\"_self\">guidelines on choosing an account</a> to use with the integration below.</dd>\n<dt>Pardot Account ID</dt>\n<dd>A unique ID that identifies your Pardot Instance. See below for instructions on how to find it.</dd>\n<dt>Pardot Campaign ID</dt>\n<dd>A unique ID that identifies the Pardot campaign in which you want to store data from Uberflip.

You will need the <strong>login credentials</strong> for this account, which are simply its <strong>email address and password</strong>.</p>\n<p>Before selecting which account you want to use for this purpose, please note the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a best practice, you should <strong>not</strong> use an account that is associated with a specific user. If you do, the integration can stop working if that user leaves your company, changes their email or password, or their account is deactivated.</li>\n<li>We recommend that you <strong>create a new account specifically for the Uberflip integration</strong>. This account should be tied to a generic email address (e.g. <em>marketing@mycompany.com</em>) that your whole team has access to. This makes it easier to fix problems with the integration should they arise.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HA398Y61TW67S638NG0FADT5\">Get your Pardot Account ID and Campaign ID</h3>\n<p>You'll also need your Pardot <strong>Account ID</strong> and <strong>Campaign ID</strong>, which can both be found in the same location in Pardot.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Pardot account using the account you will be using for the integration.</li>\n<li>In Pardot, click on <strong>Marketing &gt;</strong><strong> Campaigns.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Current Pardot Campaigns</strong> list, <strong>click on the Campaign</strong> you want to use.</li>\n<li>On the next page, click on <strong>View Tracking Code</strong> in the top right.</li>\n<li>A text box with JavaScript code will appear at the top of the page.

You you should see a banner indicating that Pardot was connected successfully, as well as the label <em>connected</em> next to Pardot in the list.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your Uberflip and Pardot accounts are now connected. Next, you'll need to decide what kind of optional data you want the integration to send to Pardot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_1907883961871547850435749\">Configure Pardot integration options</h2>\n<p>Now that you have connected Pardot to your Uberflip account, Uberflip will send lead data to Pardot anytime a visitor submits one of your Form CTAs. In addition, you can also choose to turn on <strong>options which send additional data to Pardot</strong>. This data can help you to understand how your leads are engaging with your content in Uberflip.</p>\n<p>The options you can configure are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Set Lead Sources: </strong>If enabled, Uberflip will record the specific CTA(s) a lead submitted on their profile — both the first CTA they ever submitted, and the one they submitted most recently.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Flipbook Tracking: </strong>If enabled, Uberflip will record a lead's Flipbook page views on their profile.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content Counters: </strong>If enabled, Uberflip will record counts of how many times a lead has viewed different types of content (e.g. articles, videos, etc.) on their profile.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HA398Y626W41CGAA6EKVC8FX\" class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>Most of these options use <strong>custom fields </strong>(<a href=\"#h_01EXHKV1TNS277T568WCA25F7T\" target=\"_self\">see below</a>) to record the relevant data. The exception is the the <strong>Set Lead Sources</strong> option: when this is enabled, Uberflip will update Pardot's <strong>default <em>Source</em> field</strong> on the lead profile. This will happen <strong>only if the <em>Source</em> field is empty</strong> — if it already has a value, Uberflip will not change it.</p>\n</div>\n<p>These settings are disabled by default, and the integration will still work if you choose not to enable them. However, we highly recommend turning them on.</p>\n<p><strong>To configure these options:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the <strong>Connected Services</strong> page, click on the <strong>Edit </strong>button that now appears next to Pardot in the list (under the <strong>Action </strong>column):<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/19400909526925\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Edit Settings</strong> window will open.

However, the integration will also send data for which Pardot does not have standard fields. To capture this data, you need to <strong>create custom fields in Pardot</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about Uberflip-created custom fields and how they're used in this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040307932\">Uberflip custom fields for Marketing Automation Platforms explained</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To create custom fields:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the <strong>Connected Services</strong> page, click on the <strong>Fields </strong>button next to Pardot (under the <strong>Action </strong>column):<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/19400950563213\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Service Fields</strong> window will open.

By default none of these fields will exist yet — fields that still need to be created appear in red and are indicated by an <strong>x</strong> in their <strong>Status</strong> column:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360018997551\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"572\" height=\"265\">\n</li>\n<li>To create a field, click on the <strong>+Add</strong> button beside it:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/19400950566285\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Once a field has been successfully created, its line will turn grey, the <strong>+Add</strong> button will disappear, and a checkmark will appear beside it in the <strong>Status</strong> column:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/19400909535245\" alt=\"Hubs___Integrations_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"704\" height=\"67\">\n</li>\n<li>Continue clicking the <strong>+Add </strong>button for each field until you have added all the fields you want to use, then close the Service Fields window when you're finished.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 id=\"h_122448172301547497456083\" class=\"callout__title\">Required vs. optional fields: what's the difference?</h4>\n<p><strong>Required </strong><strong>fields</strong> are either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fields that Uberflip will try to write to, but which don't exist in Pardot by default, or</li>\n<li>Fields which are associated with the <strong>Set Lead Sources/</strong><strong>Flipbook Tracking/</strong><strong>Content Counters </strong>options. <a href=\"#h_1907883961871547850435749\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">These options</a> require custom fields, so if you enable them, you must also create the corresponding fields. Note that if you do not enable these options, their fields will not appear in the Service Fields window.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Optional </strong><strong>fields</strong> are related to tracking the Item a lead converted on. These are optional because, if you do not create them, the corresponding data will still be sent to Pardot, but will simply not be recorded. Adding these optional fields will allow you to capture potentially valuable insights on which Items are your best performers in terms of conversions, so we strongly recommend adding them.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HA398Y622X1MG1MHG4V03EPQ\">Next steps</h2>\n<p>Congratulations — you've successfully integrated Pardot, and your Uberflip account is now ready to start sending data to Pardot. Now that Pardot is connected, you can begin <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020989871\">creating Pardot-connected Form CTAs</a> to start generating leads.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01HA398Y62A0CHQ064A5NFMS6H\" class=\"callout__title\">\n<strong>Important</strong>: If you use Pardot Form Handlers</h4>\n<p>If you use <a href=\"https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=pardot_form_handlers.htm&amp;type=0\" target=\"_self\">Form Handlers</a> in Pardot, you must also <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020989871#set-up-map-options\">enable the option <em>Never hide this CTA</em> </a>on any Form CTA connected to a Form Handler. This is required because Form Handlers will only submit when a Form CTA is actively submitted (bypassed Form CTAs for known leads will not submit a Form Handler).</p>\n<p>Additionally, ensure that the \"email\" field is the only field marked as <strong>required</strong> in the <strong>Form Field Mappings</strong> section of the Form Handler setup.</p>\n</div>"

Items that you've added to Sales or Marketing Streams are always \"reflections\" of the original Item that was created in its source Stream (for example, a Blog Stream, or a Flipbooks Stream). This means that if you make any changes to the Item in its source Stream, those changes will also be reflected in any Sales or Marketing Stream which that Item appears in. This also applies if you delete the Item in its Source Stream, which will simultaneously delete it from any Sales or Marketing Streams, as well.</p>"
