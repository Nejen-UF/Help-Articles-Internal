If you need help from the Support team, you can <strong>submit a support ticket</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HQ8KGFJCT6S3S9CE9YQX5D2Q\">What are support tickets, and why are they important?</h3>\n<p>Uberflip's Support team receives a lot of requests for help. To manage all of these requests, and to ensure nothing is missed or forgotten, we use a <strong>support ticket </strong>system. In this system, every request for help is represented by its own support ticket.</p>\n<p>Using support tickets allows us to:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>\n<strong>Keep track of all requests</strong>, so that we can make sure that all requests get a response.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Centralize communication related to a</strong> <strong>request</strong>, so that everyone involved has a definitive record of what's been discussed, and so we can ensure that every aspect of the request is addressed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Prioritize requests</strong>, so that we can handle the most urgent requests first (but without forgetting about requests that are less urgent, but equally important).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Guarantee a response within a specific timeframe</strong>. In fact, a support ticket is the only way to get help from the Support team that has a Service Level Agreement (SLA) behind it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Measure</strong> <strong>the business</strong>, so we know how well the Support team is performing, and whether the business is growing.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maintain a historical record</strong>. This allows us to review past events at the individual customer, account level, and overall Uberflip company level; and serves as proof of interactions. It also provides opportunities to reduce duplication of efforts should the same issue arise again in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"text-primary\">In short: support tickets help the Support team to help you.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HQ8KGFJCV4XJBZZG31YATNWA\">Do I really have to submit support tickets?</h3>\n<p>We know that submitting a support ticket seems inconvenient compared to just sending a Slack message. But<strong> without support tickets, things get missed or lost altogether </strong>— and that makes <strong>everyone</strong> unhappy (especially customers!). This is why we ask you to submit support tickets: <strong>they allow the Support team to do the best possible job for both you and the customer</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HQ8KGFJCKPRRH6XQEF91AAW1\">Where do support tickets live?</h3>\n<p>We use <strong>Zendesk</strong> as our system of record for managing support tickets. That's why you might also see support tickets referred to as <strong>\"Zendesk tickets\"</strong>.</p>\n<p>While it is mainly the Support team that works in Zendesk, all members of the Customer Experience department also have access to this system to check on the status of open support tickets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HQ8KGFJCZWPFZ5XHZ4QG9344\">Who can submit a support ticket?</h3>\n<p>Anyone who needs help from Uberflip Support. This could either be an <strong>Uberflip customer</strong> themselves, or <strong>any Uberflip team member</strong> who is looking for help on behalf of their customer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HQ8KGFJC1R2N8QF0KP4X926G\">How does a customer submit a support ticket?</h3>\n<p>There are three methods for <strong>customers</strong> to submit support tickets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Help Portal:</strong> <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com\">https://help.uberflip.com</a> (click on <em>Submit a Request</em>)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Email: </strong><a href=\"mailto:support@uberflip.com\">support@uberflip.com</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Phone: </strong>1-888-694-2946 (dial extension 2)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HQ8KGFJCNX34RPZM074QQ4MM\">How does an Uberflip team member submit a support ticket?</h3>\n<p>Follow the the process for <strong>submitting a support ticket</strong> <strong>as an Uberflip team member </strong>below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01EVHWDM53VA195FS9VWJ2CG2E\">Process: Submit a support ticket</h2>\n<p>Use this process to submit a new support ticket.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Zendesk at <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/\">https://help.uberflip.com/</a>\n</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>+Add</strong>, then <strong>New &gt; Ticket</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360081212132\" alt=\"image.png\">\n</li>\n<li>Fill in the fields on the left side:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Requester: </strong>Add the <em>customer's </em>contact information (the person Support should correspond with about the issue).  <em>This is a very critical piece of information.

Each of the available options has a definition that outlines its criteria. You can find these below:</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HQ8KGFJDE5KEMB9JJ8YNTDBW\">Severity level definitions</h4>\n<p>Use this table to help you <strong>choose the appropriate severity level</strong> for your support ticket. Remember: severity tells us <strong>how broken the affected system is</strong>.</p>\n<p>Each severity level is associated with a specific SLA (how quickly the Support team will respond to the customer), which is indicated. In addition, the table also shows the recommended priority level range for each severity level, along with the suggested CSM action.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 122.55px;\"><strong>Severity</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 135.3px;\"><strong>Definition</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 124.283px;\"><strong>SLA</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 127.317px;\"><strong>Priority</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 134.55px;\"><strong>CS Action</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 122.55px;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 135.3px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Production system down</strong> or <strong>imminent production mission critical failure</strong>, no workaround available.</span></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 124.283px;\">1 hour</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 127.317px;\">1</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 134.55px;\">Engage immediately</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 122.55px;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 135.3px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Loss of key functionality</strong> which <strong>affects significant aspects </strong>of the business or operations.</span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 124.283px;\">3 hours</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 127.317px;\">2-3</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 134.55px;\">Engage proactively</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 122.55px;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 135.3px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Issue <strong>impacting an isolated component</strong> that does not affect the ability of the system to perform in accordance with the documentation.</span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 124.283px;\">6 hours</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 127.317px;\">2-4</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 134.55px;\">Monitor closely/engage if needed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 122.55px;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 135.3px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Product is <strong>usable with limitations and workarounds</strong> – also a placeholder for <strong>general inquiries</strong>.</span></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 124.283px;\">24 hours</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 127.317px;\">2-4</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 134.55px;\">Monitor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 122.55px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 135.3px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>No system impact identified</strong> (e.g. feature tequests, user account requests, software delivery, status reports, etc.).</span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 124.283px;\">48 hours</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 127.317px;\">2-4</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 134.55px;\">Monitor</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HQ8KGFJDX6SZQGJ6N5NMDJVF\">Priority level definitions</h4>\n<p>Use this table to help you <strong>choose the appropriate priority level</strong> for your support ticket.

We need this information to contact the client, and if it's missing, this causes delays.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Creating a ticket by forwarding a customer email to <a href=\"mailto:support@uberflip.com:\">support@uberflip.com:</a> <br></strong>This also sets you (not the customer) as the Requester, and causes delays as we have to fix the ticket. In addition, often the customer's email is not clear, or worse, consists of a long thread of messages.  Instead, please follow the instructions above for submitting a ticket and paste the customer's email address into the Internal Note field when you create the ticket according to the process above.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Not providing any or enough details about the issue: </strong>If the ticket doesn't have enough information for us to go on, all we can do is ask you or the customer for the missing information. This typically results in back and forth that wastes time and is frustrating for the customer. To avoid this, please include as many details as possible, i.e. which Hub and/or specific assets are affected, steps to reproduce the issue, etc. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should also: <br></span>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Verify that the issue exists as described by the client</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Describe the issue clearly and concisely in the ticket</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provide a clear indication of the impact this issue is having for your client</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a general rule, a good support ticket is one where Support can get back to the customer with a first response directly, and <strong>does not have to follow up with you first</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HQ8KGFJF4N6HJ0A68EFN4YNM\">Escalating support tickets</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HQ8KGFJFYT14VB2HYD1ZDZ2W\">What does it mean to escalate a support ticket?</h3>\n<p>From time to time, issues come up that are <strong>extremely urgent</strong>, and need to be <strong>resolved as soon as possible</strong>. For these issues, you have the ability to <strong>escalate a support ticket</strong>.</p>\n<p>When you ask for a support ticket to be escalated, you are effectively telling the Support team:</p>\n<p><span class=\"text-primary\">\"I want you to drop what you're doing and work on this ticket ahead of all other ongoing activities.\"</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HQ8KGFJFFG8B4CN6BDBXZSMJ\">Is there anything I need to consider before I request an escalation?</h3>\n<p>While tickets legitimately <em>need</em> to be escalated in some situations, always remember that <strong>escalations </strong><strong>come at a cost</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Escalations are <strong>disruptive</strong>: they have a significant negative effect on productivity, often across multiple departments (Support, Product, Engineering, etc.), and force those involved to catch up on their regular duties after the escalation is resolved</li>\n<li>Escalations are <strong>expensive</strong>: they typically require expensive resources (management, developers, etc.) to take time away from their ongoing work to focus exclusively</li>\n<li>Escalations result in <strong>poor customer experiences</strong>: an escalation makes one customer happy, but potentially makes <em>all other</em> <em>customers </em>unhappy because work on their issues has to be delayed</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Before you escalate a ticket, keep the impact in mind</strong> and <strong>use your judgment </strong>to make sure that the situation really does call for an escalation. In some cases, this might mean reaching out to a customer to manage their expectations instead of escalating the ticket.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HQ8KGFJFN08FEQJ07C6KXJ7T\">When should I escalate a support ticket?</h3>\n<p>There are many situations where an escalation is warranted, and a comprehensive list of these situations would be impractical and not very useful. As a result, the Support team relies on you to <strong>use your judgment</strong> as to when an escalation is required.</p>\n<p>Below are a few examples of situations that would call for an escalation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The customer has made it clear to you that this issue is <strong>critical to their business objectives</strong>, so much so that it should take precedence over everything else currently being worked on.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issue is <strong>time sensitive</strong>, e.g. the issue is preventing another process from being started or completed. In this case, it's important to indicate <em>how </em>time sensitive the issue is (one hour and one month require different levels or response).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issue could <strong>impact churn or revenue</strong>, e.g. the customer is at high risk for churning, or will not discuss renewal/upgrade until the issue is resolved.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HQ8KGFJFEJHRMWNKF10AYSWF\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do I escalate a support ticket?</span></h3>\n<p>Follow the <strong>process for escalating a support ticket</strong> below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01EVHWE20VTEQTYGTEFBQ74A4T\">Process: Escalate a support ticket</h2>\n<p>Use this process to escalate an existing support ticket.

Here's how.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Before you begin</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This article is intended for Uberflip customers who <strong>use a consent management platform (CMP) </strong>that is external to Uberflip, such as <strong>OneTrust, TrustArc, Cookiebot</strong>, etc. Ideally you are using this platform with your other web properties already (but this is not strictly necessary).</li>\n<li>Using an external CMP with your Hub requires <strong>developing and implementing custom code</strong> that is specific to your organization. As a result, you will need a <strong>web developer </strong>who is <strong>proficient in JavaScript</strong> to do this. Your developer should also:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Be <strong>familiar with your CMP</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Have <strong>worked with custom code on your Uberflip Hub</strong> before, or have read <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\">the guide to using custom code</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Before your developer can get started, there are <strong>setup steps that must be completed in the Uberflip app</strong>. The necessary steps are described in this article. To complete these steps, you need to be an <strong>Account Admin</strong> or <strong>Content Manager</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About using a consent management platform with your Hub</h2>\n<p>To comply with the requirements of GDPR (and similar laws such as CCPA), many businesses rely on consent management platforms (CMPs) to manage visitor cookie consent across their various web properties. If you already use a CMP with your other web properties, you can also use it to <strong>manage cookie consent on your Uberflip Hubs </strong>through Uberflip's <strong>JS Privacy API</strong>.</p>\n<p>Using the JS Privacy API, you can <strong>configure your CMP to control <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039954991\">the cookies set by your Uberflip Hub</a> </strong>alongside those set by your other web properties. This means that cookie preferences set by a visitor on any of your integrated web properties will also apply to your Hub, and vice versa:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a visitor has <strong>already set their cookie preferences on any other web property</strong> integrated with your CMP, these preferences will also apply to your Hub(s), and the privacy banner/controls will not appear the first time this visitor enters your Hub</li>\n<li>If a visitor enters your Hub and <strong>has not yet visited any of your other web properties</strong>, they will be shown your CMP's privacy banner/controls to set their cookie preferences, and these will also apply when they visit your other web properties</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The primary benefit of doing this is that your visitors will only have to set their privacy preferences once, resulting in a more user-friendly experience with less friction across all your web properties.</p>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>The most common approach to cookie consent management is to <strong>group cookies by their basic function</strong>, which allows visitors to opt-in to or opt-out of <em>types</em> of cookies, rather than individually. Most CMPs are based around this <strong>\"cookie categories\"</strong> approach, and Uberflip implements the same idea with <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020222171#set-up-privacy-groups\"><strong>Privacy Groups</strong></a>. When Privacy Groups are enabled on a Hub, visitors can use the controls on the built-in Privacy Page to manage their cookie preferences by either accepting or declining individual Privacy Groups (and hence all cookies associated with the Privacy Group).</p>\n<p>The purpose of the JS Privacy API is to replace this mechanism by <strong>linking Uberflip Privacy Groups to the cookie categories in your CMP</strong>. Using the API, your CMP can <strong>control Uberflip Privacy Groups</strong>, opting in or out based on the visitor's existing stored preferences for the equivalent cookie category (i.e. as set on another site). Likewise, you can display your CMP's privacy controls on your Hub, and use the API to <strong>sync cookie</strong> <strong>preferences back your CMP </strong>so that they can be applied to other sites.</p>\n<p>To use the JS Privacy API, you need to <strong>develop a piece of JavaScript custom code</strong> that is deployed on your Hub. This code will <strong>manage the communication between your CMP and the JS Privacy API</strong>, allowing the CMP to get information from Uberflip about your Hub's Privacy Groups and their status for each visitor, and to change their status as needed to match the visitor's existing settings in your CMP (if present). When this code is implemented, your CMP will act as the <strong>source of truth</strong>: your Hub will always get information about a visitor's privacy preferences from the CMP, and will always send any preferences set on the Hub back to the CMP for storage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Prepare your Hub to connect a CMP</h2>\n<p>In order to integrate your Hub with a CMP, there are several settings you will need to configure first to ensure the Hub is prepared.</p>\n<h3>Turn off the Uberflip Privacy Page</h3>\n<p>Because you will be using an external privacy policy page and the CMP's privacy controls, you need to <strong>disable the equivalent Privacy Page feature</strong> <strong>in Uberflip</strong> to avoid conflicts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu, click on <strong>Hub Privacy &gt; Privacy Policy</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360077970991/JS_Privacy_-_Hub_Privacy_-_Confluence.png\" alt=\"JS_Privacy_-_Hub_Privacy_-_Confluence.png\" width=\"240\" height=\"122\">\n</li>\n<li>In the settings menu, <strong>turn off the Enable Privacy Page setting </strong>by toggling it to the OFF (grey) position:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360077810312/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\" width=\"416\" height=\"114\">\n</li>\n<li>Your changes will be saved automatically.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Turn off the Uberflip Privacy Banner</h3>\n<p>Uberflip also has a built-in privacy banner feature. As you will be using the CMP's privacy banner instead, you must <strong>ensure that the built-in Uberflip privacy banner is turned off</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the sidebar menu, click on <strong>Hub Privacy &gt; Privacy Banner</strong>:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360077810472/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\" width=\"241\" height=\"123\">\n</li>\n<li>In the settings menu, <strong>turn off the Enable Privacy Banner setting </strong>by toggling it to the OFF (grey) position:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360077810532/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\" width=\"373\" height=\"115\">\n</li>\n<li>Your changes will be saved automatically.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Create and configure Privacy Groups</h3>\n<p>The JS Privacy API allows the CMP to control your Hub's cookie settings by giving it access to Uberflip's built-in Privacy Groups functionality. As a result, you will need to <strong>create and set up Privacy Groups </strong>in your Hub if you have not yet done so. Doing this will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Stop your Hub from setting any cookies</strong> unless a visitor opts-in, as required by GDPR</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Group functionally related cookies together</strong> so that you can map them equivalent cookie categories in your CMP</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Provide</strong> <strong>a mechanism that your CMP can hook into</strong> so that it can control which cookies your Hub will set, depending on a visitor's preferences</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find <strong>detailed instructions on how to set up Privacy Groups</strong> in <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020222171#set-up-privacy-groups\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p>If possible, we recommend structuring your Privacy Groups in the same way as the cookie categories in your CMP, in order to simplify mapping.</p>\n<p>Remember that, in addition to creating Privacy Groups, you must also use the <em>Functionality </em>tab to <strong>ensure all cookie-setting services in your Hub are assigned to a group</strong>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360077885492/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\" width=\"382\" height=\"248\"></p>\n<h3>Map Privacy Groups to equivalent CMP cookie categories</h3>\n<p>To link your CMP's cookie categories to their corresponding Uberflip Privacy Groups in their code, your developer will need to understand the relationship between the two. For this reason, we recommend that you <strong>make a list of both your Uberflip Privacy Groups and the cookie categories in your CMP</strong>, then <strong>map out which ones are equivalent</strong> to one another. For example:</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Uberflip Privacy Group name</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>CMP cookie category name</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Essential</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Strictly necessary</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Analytics</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Statistics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">...</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">...</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Note that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each Privacy Group must be mapped to a cookie category in your CMP, as your CMP will not be able to control unmapped Privacy Groups</li>\n<li>You can map multiple (or even all) Privacy Groups to one cookie category, if needed</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Develop the CMP integration code</h2>\n<p>Once this setup work is complete, your developer can begin work on the code that integrates your CMP with your Hub. This involves two pieces of code:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Code to <strong>display the CPM's privacy banner/cookie consent controls</strong> on your Hub</li>\n<li>Code that <strong>integrates the Hub with the CPM using the JS Privacy API</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To support your developer with this project, instructions, sample code, and API reference materials are provided on Uberflip's developer site, here:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://developers.uberflip.com/docs/introduction-to-the-js-privacy-api\"><strong>Uberflip Developers: Using the JSPrivacy API</strong></a></p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>As with all custom development work on your Hub (especially development involving third-party software platforms), Uberflip Support is unable to provide coding support, and may only be able to provide limited troubleshooting assistance.</p>\n<p>If you need help with developing this type of solution, please contact your Customer Success Manager to discuss your options for engaging Uberflip Professional Services or an Uberflip Partner.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Deploy the code</h2>\n<p>Once the necessary code has been developed, work with your developer to deploy it on your Hub using <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\">Uberflip custom code</a>. As soon as the relevant custom code blocks are active, your CMP will be integrated with your Hub in the same way as with your other web properties.</p>"

Learn why we're doing this, and how it affects you.</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>This announcement is for <strong>an event that has already happened</strong>. It remains available for reference purposes only.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>What's changing?</h2>\n<p>Adobe has <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html\">announced that they will \"end-of-life\" Flash Player</a> on <strong>December 31, 2020</strong>. As a result, Uberflip's <strong>Flash-based Flipbooks viewer will stop working</strong> <strong>on </strong><strong>January 1, 2021</strong>, and we will be removing the Flash-based Flipbooks viewer functionality from the Uberflip platform in early January.</p>\n<p><strong>Only customers who are still using Flash Flipbooks are affected by this change</strong>. As of January 1, 2021, any Flipbooks that are still set up to use the Flash Flipbooks viewer will remain accessible, but <strong>visitors must choose to use the alternative HTML5-based Flipbooks viewer </strong>instead. To provide a better user experience, <strong>we strongly recommend configuring your Flipbooks to automatically open in the HTML5 viewer before this date</strong>. Please read on for further details.</p>\n<p>Additionally, note that some features which were available with Adobe Flash-based Flipbooks are not available with (or not applicable to) HTML5-based Flipbooks. Please refer to the <a href=\"#h_01EKWZQGGQ8JJNWX28Y88B4VRC\" target=\"_self\">Additional information</a> section for a full list.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Why is Uberflip making this change?</h2>\n<p>In July 2017, <a href=\"https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2017/07/25/adobe-flash-update.html#gs.hp6pkd\">Adobe announced their plan to end-of-life Flash Player</a> by December 31, 2020. After this date, <strong>Adobe will consider Flash Player a \"dead\" technology</strong>, and will no longer distribute, update, or support it. Adobe will also<strong> prompt all remaining users to uninstall Flash Player</strong>, and will <strong>block Flash Player from displaying content </strong>after the end-of-life date even if it remains installed. For these reasons, Uberflip can no longer support the Flash-based version of the Flipbooks viewer, and must retire it.</p>\n<p>We understand that some of our customers are still using Flash-based Flipbooks, and will be disappointed by this news. However, <strong>better and more secure technologies</strong> (i.e. HTML5) have largely replaced Flash on the web, and most browser vendors have <strong>blocked Flash by default</strong> for several years now. In fact, <strong>Uberflip has already partly deprecated Flash Flipbooks</strong>: due to the increasing number of web users who do not have Flash (including mobile users), Uberflip has for some time now offered an alternative HTML5 version whenever a Flash Flipbook is displayed.</p>\n<p>Although Uberflip has supported the Flash-based Flipbooks viewer for as long as possible, the writing is on the wall: with the end-of-life date set by Adobe, <strong>Uberflip has no choice but to retire Flash-based Flipbooks at the end of 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_50a40ce7-374f-4d7f-b50f-ec1c3d51bcff\">Who is affected by this change?</h2>\n<p>This change <strong>only affects customers who are still using Flash-based Flipbooks</strong>, i.e. those who have Flipbook Folders set to the <em>Flash on Desktop/HTML5 on Mobile </em>setting. </p>\n<p>Customers who are <strong>only using non-Flash Flipbooks types</strong> (i.e. HTML5, HTML5 (SVG) and Native PDF) are <strong>not affected by this change</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Does this mean I can't use Flipbooks at all anymore?</h2>\n<p><strong>The Flipbooks product is not going away</strong>: you will still be able to create and publish Flipbooks using any of the other available options, i.e. <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>HTML5 (SVG)</strong>, and <strong>Native PDF</strong>. Only the Adobe Flash option is being retired.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What do I need to do to prepare?</h2>\n<p>After December 31, 2020, your visitors will still be able to view Flipbooks configured to use the Flash-based viewer, but <strong>the viewer itself will no longer work</strong>. Instead, visitors must manually select the backup HTML5 option to view any Flash-based Flipbook:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360071476252/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\" width=\"229\" height=\"269\"></p>\n<p>This experience may be confusing to your visitors. As a result, <strong>we strongly recommend that you switch your Flash Flipbooks Folders to the HTML5 setting as soon as possible</strong>. This will automatically launch your Flipbooks in the HTML5 viewer, providing a much smoother experience for your visitors.</p>\n<p>To make the switch, simply <strong>change the <em>Reader Version</em> dropdown on any applicable Folder</strong> from <em>Flash on Desktop/HTML5 on Mobile</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360075067892/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<p> To <em>HTML5</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360075067912/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\" width=\"710\" height=\"68\"></p>\n<p>The change will take effect immediately, and Flipbooks within that Folder will now automatically open in the HTML5 viewer right away.</p>\n<p>(You may also choose a different option, but we recommend using the <em>HTML5</em> option as it is the closest equivalent to Flash Flipbooks.)</p>\n<p>Because <strong>certain features of Flash Flipbooks are not available in HTML5</strong>, we also recommend that you <strong>review the <a href=\"#h_01EKWZQGGQ8JJNWX28Y88B4VRC\" target=\"_self\">Additional</a></strong><a href=\"#h_01EKWZQGGQ8JJNWX28Y88B4VRC\" target=\"_self\"><strong> information </strong><strong>section</strong></a> (below) prior to December 31, in order to understand how your and your visitors' experience may change.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What will happen if I don't do anything?</h2>\n<p>As noted above, Flipbooks set to use the Flash viewer will still be viewable with HTML5 after December 31, but the user experience will not be ideal.</p>\n<p>In addition, <strong>Uberflip will be retiring the Flash Flipbooks technology </strong>from our platform <strong>by January 15</strong>. In practical terms, this means that the <em>Flash on Desktop/HTML5 on Mobile</em> option will be removed from the product, and it will no longer be possible to create new Folders with this setting, or to enable this setting on existing Folders. At the same time, any Flipbooks Folders that are still set to the <em>Flash on Desktop/HTML5 on Mobile </em>setting will be<strong> switched to the <em>HTML5</em> setting automatically</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>Flipbooks Folders that are already set to HTML5, HTML5 (SVG), or Native PDF <strong>will not be affected by this change</strong> <strong>in any way.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01EKWZQGGQ8JJNWX28Y88B4VRC\">Additional information</h2>\n<p>The HTML5 Flipbooks viewer supports the vast majority of features that were present in the Flash Flipbooks viewer. However, <strong>certain specific features are not available</strong>. These are primarily features that Uberflip has retired because they were not widely used, or were no longer necessary/applicable with HTML5.</p>\n<p>The main features from Flash Flipbooks that were <strong>not implemented in HTML5 Flipbooks</strong> are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Custom Embed widget</strong> (sidebar displaying custom code)</li>\n<li>The <strong>Interface Language</strong> option (an option to change the language of the Flipbooks viewer UI)</li>\n<li>The <strong>My Account</strong> tab (an options tab displayed in the Flipbooks viewer UI as part of <em>Subscribers</em> functionality)</li>\n<li>Various Flash-specific <strong>Desktop Flipbooks toolbar</strong> functions and options</li>\n<li>Various Flash-specific <strong>PDF-to-Flipbook processing options</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is a detailed breakdown of the Flash Flipbooks viewer features that are not available in the HTML5 Flipbooks viewer.

For more information, check out <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/5649118635405-Announcement-Retiring-SnapApp-Aug-2022-\" target=\"_self\">Announcement: Retiring SnapApp</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<p>Learn what the 10 best practices are when using SnapApp </p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SnapApp helps marketers take the guesswork out of getting great leads. Whether youʼre just getting started or just need a refresher, there are a few rules of thumb to keep in mind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Best practice 1: Ask qualifying questions</h2>\n<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>\n<p>The greatest value from SnapApp is learning something about your prospects that you can only get by asking. Asking the right questions can help engage and convert a prospect into a lead, give them a more personalized journey, and improve lead quality.</p>\n<p>While you have their attention, ask prospects something that will help you follow up with the right nurture stream, or send them to sales based on their intent.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Best practice 2: Save questions in question bank</h2>\n<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>\n<p>There is no limit to how many questions you can ask, but in order for response data to be useful, consistency in how you ask is critical. Question bank gives you a single location to store and manage your questions. You can also organize them by categories, or set the order in which they should be displayed in apps that use progressive questions.</p>\n<h2> </h2>\n<h2>Best practice 3: Connect to a Marketing Automation tool</h2>\n<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>\n<p>SnapApp integrates with most marketing automation platforms so you can make lead response data actionable. Connecting SnapApp to marketing automation ensures that lead data is passed immediately and seamlessly to your system of record, and you can use responses to segment and prioritize leads, add them to workflows and cadences, and create smart lists. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Best practice 4: Keep design simple </h2>\n<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>\n<p>One personʼs delightful engaging experience is someone elseʼs confusing interruption. SnapApp has one mission: to help you know more about your leads. By keeping questions front and center, and designing to blend into your website and content, our apps remove barriers between you and the prospect, and the information exchange that can lead to a business relationship. Minimize distractions and make it easy to stay focused on the questions<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Best practice 5: Use apps wherever you get traffic</h2>\n<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>\n<p>Your content is already working hard to attract and engage your audience. But it doesnʼt always give them a path to convert, or an obvious next step if theyʼre not yet ready to contact you. Instead of downloading a PDF and forgetting about it, your prospect can read through a PDF question app and then get a recommendation for more content when they finish. A question app embedded in a blog can lead the prospect to a product page or long-form content about a related topic. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Best practice 6: Embed only one app per page</h2>\n<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>\n<p>When we want a visitor to take action on a page, such as completing a form or clicking a CTA, we try not to have competing forms or CTAs present. Fewer choices increases likelihood of completion. SnapApps behave similarly—they contain lead forms and calls to action as well as questions—and should not be competing for attention with other apps or forms. If you want to lead your prospect to the next piece of content, use the CTA in your app.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Best practice 7: Make it easy for your prospects</h2>\n<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>\n<p>The cardinal rule of good web design and user interaction is “Donʼt make me think!” The more time your prospect spends trying to read and understand your question or choose the most appropriate answer, the less the likelihood they will actually complete it. Keep questions and answer options simple, and limit how many questions you use per app.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Best practice 8: Provide a relevant CTA</h2>\n<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>\n<p>If your prospect is unsure of the next step, the step they take might be leaving your website or landing page. Always include a call to action that points them to a related piece of content, or, if appropriate for the content they just viewed, to your contact or demo request page. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Best practice 9: Track performance</h2>\n<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>\n<p>Improving app performance starts with tracking. SnapApp has a built in analytics dashboard that displays important engagement and conversion data for each app, and for all your apps in aggregate. Use this data to make improvements and learn what works for your audience. To take your tracking to the next level, talk to your CSM about additional tracking options.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Best practice 10: Share data with sales</h2>\n<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>\n<p>Lead response data is a powerful tool for improving campaign performance and effectiveness, because you can better segment your leads and only send them relevant messaging. The same insights are equally powerful when used by sales to tailor their talk track for each lead—and to identify which leads to call first.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Bonus best practices</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If you're using our PDF or Express tool, set up lead alerts to notify anyone on your team when new leads arrive—and how they responded.</li>\n<li>Create brand templates to speed up app creation.</li>\n<li>Experiment: Our best practices are a great starting point, but try adding or subtracting questions, moving them around, changing where you put the lead form, etc. to see what has the greatest benefit for your conversion rates.</li>\n</ul>"

There are three <strong>levels</strong> at which app settings can be applied:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>\n<strong>Account Level Settings:</strong> These settings apply across all Hubs in your Uberflip account — even Hubs you add after you first installed and configured an app. Account level settings allow you to quickly configure an app for multiple Hubs at once.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hub Level Settings: </strong>These settings apply only to the Hub where they were configured. When you configure an app's settings at the Hub level, they will override any account level settings for that app in just that Hub (other Hubs without their own Hub level settings will still use the account level settings, if configured).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stream Level Settings: </strong>These settings apply only to the Stream where they were configured. When you configure an app's settings at the Stream level, they will override any account or Hub level settings for that app in just that Stream (other Streams without their own Stream level settings will still use the account or Hub level settings, if configured).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this article, we'll look at <strong>how to open the Account Level, Hub Level, and Stream Level settings pages</strong> in the Uberflip platform to configure your installed apps.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>This article provides general instructions on how to find the Uberflip platform's built-in app settings pages.

            "body": "<h2>About Deleting UFA Data</h2>\n<p>Customers may ask us to delete data collected by Uberflip Analytics. There are two main scenarios in which a customer might make this request:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They have received a \"right to be forgotten request\" (GDPR) from a person who has visited one or more of their Hubs, and must delete that user's data from Uberflip Analytics</li>\n<li>They want to delete all data collected by Uberflip Analytics for all Hubs under their account</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Uberflip Analytics (UFA) has <strong>Data Control</strong><strong>s</strong> which are designed to service these requests. There are two functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Delete Visitor Data: </strong>Deletes any UFA visitor data related to a specific unique identifier (UUID) that was assigned to a visitor's browser</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Delete All Data: </strong>Delete all UFA data associated with a particular Uberflip account (including all Hubs belonging to the account)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both options are <strong>permanent</strong>: any UFA data deleted using Data Controls is <strong>not recoverable</strong>.</p>\n<p>The current implementation of Data Controls is not ready for end users, and is only accessible through a direct URL that is intended to be used by Uberflip Support. As a result, <strong>Uberflip Support must assist customers with requests to delete UFA data at this time</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_a23722cb-0cda-4d15-9f54-ab49263b76fa\">Access UFA Data Controls</h2>\n<p>To delete UFA data for a customer, use UFA Data Controls. You must access Data Controls from the Uberflip app while logged into a customer's account, but it is not possible to navigate there using the app menus. Instead, you must <strong>use the direct URL for the Data Controls page</strong> to access it.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--danger\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Warning</h4>\n<p>The current version of Data Controls is <strong>not intended for use by customers</strong>. As a result, please <strong>do not share the direct URL to the Data Controls page with any customer</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Using the Admin backend, log in to the customer's account.</li>\n<li>Once you are logged in, use the following URL to open the Data Controls page:<br> <code class=\"no-padding\">https://app.uberflip.com/analytics/data_controls</code>\n</li>\n<li>The Data Controls page for the customer's account should load, where you can delete data from UFA either for just a specific visitor, or across the whole account.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Delete a Visitor's UFA Data from a Customer Account</h2>\n<p>Under certain privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR), visitors to a website can request that the website operator delete any personal data that has been collected about them, including data collected by web analytics tools like UFA.</p>\n<p>In general, a visitor who wants their website data to be deleted would send this request to the Uberflip customer who owns the relevant Hub(s). Because the customer is not able to delete UFA data themselves, they would need to pass the request on to Uberflip — either by working with Uberflip Support on behalf of the visitor, or by asking the visitor to contact Uberflip Support directly.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>The <strong>visitor</strong> and the <strong>customer</strong> are <strong>not</strong> the same person. For the purposes of the instructions below, the labels \"visitor\" and \"customer\" have the following definitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Visitor</strong>: The third-party individual who has visited a customer's Hub(s), and is asking for their data to be deleted.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Customer</strong>: The Uberflip customer who owns the Hub that the visitor viewed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For simplicity, the instructions assume you are speaking with the <strong>visitor</strong> directly. If you are communicating with the <strong>customer</strong>, keep in mind that steps directed at the visitor can <strong>not</strong> be completed by the customer on the visitor's behalf. Instead, you would need to <strong>ask the customer to instruct the visitor</strong> to complete them.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_6c99a26a-b782-4462-9b75-b29191bbb0ae\">Step 1: Get The Visitor's UUID</h3>\n<p>To delete the data associated with a specific individual visitor, Uberflip requires that visitor's <strong>UUID </strong>(universally unique identifier).</p>\n<p>UFA assigns a UUID to each browser that loads an Uberflip Hub, and all data that UFA collects about a browser is tagged with its UUID. Therefore, we use the UUID to identify and delete all data relating to a particular browser (i.e. visitor) within the UFA database.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>UFA assigns UUIDs at the <strong>account level</strong>. This means that a browser will have the same UUID across all Hubs that belong to the same Uberflip account. If a browser enters two Hubs that belong to two separate Uberflip accounts, it will be assigned two separate UUIDs (one per account).</p>\n<p>UFA also assigns UUIDs per <strong>browser</strong>, so every separate browser (including mobile browsers) that a visitor uses to view an Uberflip Hub will receive its own UUID. As a result, a visitor may have <strong>multiple UUIDs</strong> within a given customer's account.</p>\n</div>\n<p>When a visitor asks for their UFA data to be deleted, <strong>Uberflip has no way of determining what that visitor's UUID is</strong>: UFA data is identified only with a UUID, and is not linked to other personal information (e.g. name, email, etc.) that could be used to associate the UUID with a specific individual. As a result, <strong>the visitor must provide their UUID to Uberflip </strong>in order for us to complete their request.</p>\n<p>There are two ways that a visitor can provide their UUID to Uberflip:</p>\n<div class=\"tabs\">\n<div class=\"tabs-menu\">\n<span class=\"tabs-link is-active\">Direct Method: Find UUID With DevTools</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Indirect Method: Infer UUID With Dedicated Item</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab\">\n<p>The visitor can extract their own UUID from their browser data using DevTools and provide it to Uberflip.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>\n<strong>Pro</strong>: Requires no setup or action by Uberflip Support or the customer — the visitor simply provides the UUID.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Con:</strong> The process to find the UUID may be intimidating and difficult to complete for a non-technical visitor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To use:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Notify the visitor</strong> that we will need their UUID to identify and delete their UFA data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Instruct the visitor on how to find their UUID</strong> using DevTools. The following article describes the process, and can also be provided to the visitor directly: <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041466972\">Find Your Uberflip Analytics Identifier (UUID)</a>.</li>\n<li>After the visitor has provided their UUID, you can proceed with deleting their UFA data.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab is-hidden\">\n<p>The visitor can view view a purpose-built Item that is shared only with them. This allows Uberflip to infer their UUID by subsequently viewing analytics for the Item in UFA: because nobody else viewed the Item, there should only be one pageview recorded, and the UUID associated with this pageview must belong to the visitor in question. </p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>\n<strong>Pro</strong>: Very low difficulty for the average visitor — requires minimal action and no technical knowledge on their part.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Con</strong>: Requires setup and action by Uberflip or the customer. Visitors who want their UFA data to be deleted may be unwilling to visit another Uberflip page, and it may be challenging to explain why this action is necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To use:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a <strong>hidden/no-index</strong> Item in the customer's Hub.\n<ul>\n<li>Can be in <strong>any Hub belonging to the same account</strong> that the visitor wants their data deleted from. </li>\n<li>Make a note of the <strong>Item ID</strong>, as you will need it for a later step.</li>\n<li>The Item does not need any content, but it may be helpful to provide some minimal explanatory text, or something like \"Thank you, you should receive a response to your request shortly\", etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Notify the visitor that they need to visit a special page</strong> so that Uberflip can identify and delete their UFA data.

There are two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Delete data for a specific visitor</strong>: This option allows you to delete the data Uberflip Analytics has collected about a specific visitor to your Hub(s).

Use this option if you need to comply with a \"right to be forgotten\" request.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Delete all data</strong>: This option will delete <strong>all</strong> data collected by Uberflip Analytics for all Hubs in your account. This cannot be reversed, and data deleted in this way is not recoverable, so this option is intended only for situations where you will never need this data again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you would like to use either of these options to delete data from Uberflip Analytics, please <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\" target=\"_self\">contact Uberflip Support</a> for assistance.</p>"

            "body": "<hr>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">An internal reference guide to the rate limits we set on our services.</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"callout callout--danger\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Internal Use Only</h4>\n<p><strong>The information in this article is for INTERNAL USE ONLY. It must not be shared outside of Uberflip.</strong> See <a href=\"#h_01b48499-fc9f-4b73-861a-cfd8970c5426\" target=\"_self\">here</a> for further details.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About Uberflip's Rate Limits</h2>\n<h3>What is a rate limit?</h3>\n<p>A <strong>rate limit</strong> is simply the maximum number of requests that a server will accept and process from a given IP address over a given time period. Uberflip sets and enforces rate limits to prevent our servers from becoming overloaded with requests, which can lead to service outages.</p>\n<h3>What happens when a rate limit is exceeded?</h3>\n<p>Rate limits are expressed as <em>number of requests/time period</em>. If an IP address sends requests to Uberflip's servers at a rate that exceeds the rate limit, the server will stop processing requests from that IP, and will instead return an error for each request (<code class=\"no-padding\">429 Too Many Requests</code>). The server will continue to return errors instead of processing requests until the IP address reduces the rate at which it sends requests to below the rate limit.</p>\n<h3>How do Uberflip's rate limits work?</h3>\n<p>Rate limits apply to all Uberflip frontend services, which are publicly-accessible, Uberflip-operated services that can directly receive requests from users sent over the internet.</p>\n<p>There are three categories of rate limits, <strong>high</strong>, <strong>medium</strong>, and <strong>low. </strong>Each Uberflip service falls into one of these categories, which defines the allowable rate limit for the services it contains. For example, services in the <em>high</em> category have a higher rate limit than those in the <em>medium</em> category, and so on.</p>\n<p>Within each category, the specific rate limit applies <strong>per service</strong> and <strong>per unique IP</strong> <strong>address</strong>. This means that the number of requests any single IP address makes to <em>Service A</em> does not impact the number of requests that same IP address can make to <em>Service B</em> in the same category. Likewise, requests made by <em>IP Address 1</em> to a service don't impact the requests that <em>IP Address 2</em> can make to the same service.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Rate Limits</h2>\n<p>Each category consists of two types of rate limit: the <strong>average rate</strong> and the <strong>burst rate</strong>. The average rate is the <em>maximum</em> <em>sustainable</em> rate of requests, so exceeding this rate will cause you to be rate limited <em>eventually</em>. The burst rate is the <em>absolute</em> <em>maximum</em> rate of requests — you can hit this limit very briefly, but if you exceed this rate, you will be rate limited <em>immediately</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Why are there two types of rate limit?</h4>\n<p>Uberflip's rate limiting mechanism employs a <em>leaky bucket algorithm</em>, in which incoming requests go into a \"bucket\" that \"leaks\" a particular rate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the bucket fills up, the rate limit has been exceeded. Any further requests will not go into the bucket (be processed), but will instead overflow (return an error).</li>\n<li>The <strong>average rate</strong> is the rate at which the bucket leaks: as long as requests leak out of the bucket faster than they are dripping into the bucket, the bucket can never fill up.</li>\n<li>The <strong>burst rate</strong> is the size of the bucket: if the rate at which requests drip into the bucket is the same as the size of the bucket, the bucket will fill up instantly. In practice, this means that the bucket can (very briefly) accept requests at a rate higher than the average, but this will lead to a \"full bucket\" situation much faster.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<table style=\"height: 266px;\" width=\"764\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 179.75px;\"><strong>Category</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 179.75px;\"><strong>Average Rate</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 179.75px;\"><strong>Burst Rate</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 179.75px;\"><strong>Applies to</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 179.75px;\">High</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 179.75px;\">\n<strong>1200</strong> requests/minute</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 179.75px;\">\n<strong>2400</strong> requests/minute</td>\n<td style=\"width: 179.75px;\">High-demand services (API, UFA, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 179.75px;\">Medium</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 179.75px;\">\n<strong>400</strong> requests/minute</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 179.75px;\">\n<strong>800</strong> requests/minute</td>\n<td style=\"width: 179.75px;\">Moderate-demand services (Uberflip front end)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 179.75px;\">Low</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 179.75px;\">\n<strong>200</strong> requests/minute</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 179.75px;\">\n<strong>400</strong> requests/minute</td>\n<td style=\"width: 179.75px;\">Low-demand auxiliary services (certificate generation, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01b48499-fc9f-4b73-861a-cfd8970c5426\" class=\"callout__title\">Why can't I share these rate limits with customers?</h4>\n<p>The rate limits outlined on this page are intended to protect the Uberflip platform from attacks that may destabilize it.

This article is provided for reference purposes only.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Issue Description</h2>\n<p><span class=\"text-primary\">Updated <strong>September 28<br></strong></span></p>\n<p>Originally, changes that Google made in their authentication mechanisms for third-party integrations negatively impacted the integration between Uberflip and YouTube. We submitted a new version of the integration to Google, which successfully resolved the original authentication issue on <strong>April 2, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this caused <strong>a different problem</strong>. As a large number of customers attempted to resume using the YouTube integration, the resulting spike in usage caused the integration to <strong>exceed the number of requests it is allowed to make</strong> to the YouTube API. As a result, customers experienced <strong>errors when trying to re-authorize and update YouTube Streams</strong>.</p>\n<p>As an <strong>interim solution</strong>, we <strong>reduced the number of videos that could be imported</strong> from YouTube (max. 50)<strong> </strong>as well as <strong>how</strong><strong> frequently YouTube Streams are auto-updated</strong> (once per 24 hours). These changes successfully mitigated the issue while we worked on a permanent solution, which was delivered on <strong>September 25</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 id=\"h_0d38a6ec-2c37-4e21-8537-1f09c543b066\" class=\"callout__title\">Final Update: September 28, 2020</h4>\n<p>As of <strong>September 25</strong>, Google has granted a further increase in Uberflip's API request limit for YouTube. In combination with the other improvements we have made to the integration's efficiency, this latest development has now allowed us to <strong>return the YouTube integration to full functionality</strong>.</p>\n<p>As a result of this change, the interim import limit of 50 videos and Stream update frequency of once per 24 hours <strong>are no longer in effect</strong>. Instead, we have returned to the following service parameters for the YouTube integration with immediate effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Import limit of up to <strong>500 videos</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Automated Stream refresh (importing of new videos) frequency of <strong>once per</strong><strong> hour</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the YouTube integration is once again fully functional, this known issue is <strong>now marked as RESOLVED.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Impact &amp; Actions</h2>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important: Read Before Proceeding</h4>\n<p>If you had existing YouTube Streams <strong>created</strong> <strong>before March 25, 2020</strong>, the impacts and actions described in this section remain applicable.</p>\n<p>If you have not yet done so, <strong>you can follow the steps below to re-authorize your YouTube integration and/or create new YouTube Streams</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n<h4><strong>IMPACT</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>On <strong>March 25</strong>, <strong>all existing YouTube Streams were disconnected</strong> when the old YouTube integration was deactivated in order to submit a new integration to Google. The new integration was <strong>released on April 2</strong>.</li>\n<li>Any YouTube Streams that existed in your Hub on March 25 <strong>will remain disconnected until you take action.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>To <strong>reconnect your YouTube Streams</strong>, you must <strong>re-authorize the integration </strong>between your Uberflip account and your YouTube (Google) account.</li>\n<li>While they are disconnected, YouTube Streams <strong>will not pull in new content. </strong>However, <strong>videos imported before the Stream was disconnected </strong>will <strong>continue to work normally</strong> (i.e. can be viewed by visitors and added to Marketing/Sales Streams) while the Stream remains disconnected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>ACTIONS</strong></h4>\n<p>To <strong>re-authorize the YouTube integration</strong> and reconnect your YouTube Streams that are currently disconnected:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open this article: <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041233912#connect-your-uberflip-and-google-accounts\"><strong>Set Up a YouTube Integration</strong></a>.</li>\n<li>Follow the instructions under the section <em><strong>Connect Your Uberflip and Google Accounts</strong></em> (direct link to this section <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041233912#connect-your-uberflip-and-google-accounts\">here</a>).<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>When you are asked to choose a Google account during the re-authorization process, <strong>it must be the same account that was connected to your Hub previously</strong>. If you choose a different account, the re-authorization will be successful, but your existing Streams <strong>will not reconnect</strong> (because they are associated with a different Google account).</li>\n<li>You do <strong>NOT</strong> need to complete the steps under <strong><em>Create a New YouTube Stream</em> </strong>in the same article.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You only need to re-authorize the YouTube integration<strong> ONCE</strong>. As soon as you do this, <strong>all YouTube Streams across all Hubs</strong> in your Uberflip account will reconnect, and should resume importing content from YouTube automatically.</p>\n<p>There is <strong>no deadline</strong> for re-authorizing the YouTube integration, and you can complete this action at any time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_d3c0f813-48cd-42d9-a6d8-70432acd1cb8\">Resolution Details &amp; Timeline</h2>\n<p>To permanently resolve this issue and restore full functionality, we pursued two separate but complementary approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We <strong>redesigned the YouTube integration to be more efficient</strong>. This involved analyzing how the integration previously worked, and identifying areas where we could reduce the number of calls the integration needs to make while still retaining comparable levels of functionality. This work was completed <strong>September 18, 2020</strong>.</li>\n<li>We worked with Google to <strong>significantly </strong><strong>increase Uberflip's request limit on the YouTube API</strong>. This gives Uberflip's YouTube integration the capacity required to restore full functionality. The increased limit was approved and implemented on <strong>September 25, 2020</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Full functionality was restored by <strong>September 25, 2020</strong>, fully resolving this issue.</p>"

The reason for this is that UFA and Legacy Metrics each have their own, separate methods for measuring or calculating data points — including those that have the same name in both systems. <em><br></em></p>\n<p>This guide outlines these \"shared\" data points that appear in both systems, and describes how each one is measured or calculated.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Common Data Points: Known Differences</h2>\n<p>The table below lists data points that appear in both Uberflip Analytics and Legacy Metrics under the same name, whether you can expect differences when comparing these data points across the two systems, and if so, the reason why:</p>\n<table style=\"height: 499px;\" width=\"818\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 193.05px;\"><strong>Name</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 194px;\"><strong>Description</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 199.033px;\"><strong> Differences</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 186.917px;\"><strong>Reason</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 193.05px;\">CTA Impressions</td>\n<td style=\"width: 194px;\">The number of times CTAs were seen by visitors</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 199.033px;\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Yes</span></strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 186.917px;\">Different measurement method (see below for details)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 193.05px;\">CTA Submissions</td>\n<td style=\"width: 194px;\">The number of times Form CTAs were completed and submitted</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 199.033px;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green120\"><strong>No</strong></span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 186.917px;\">Same measurement method in both systems</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 193.05px;\">Time on Page</td>\n<td style=\"width: 194px;\">The amount of time</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 199.033px;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\"><strong>Yes</strong></span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 186.917px;\">\n<p>Different measurement method (see below for details)</p>\n<p>Includes Flipbooks in Legacy Metrics, but not in Uberflip Analytics</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note: Custom code and CTA event collection</h4>\n<p>Many Hubs use <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018841312\" target=\"_self\">custom code</a> to implement non-standard functionality or change the Hub's default appearance.

Like most web applications and services, the Uberflip platform must write data to a visitor's browser to enable various types of functionality. It does this in the form of both traditional <strong>browser cookies</strong> as well as a similar HTML5 technology known as <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp\"><strong>web storage</strong></a>. (As these two types of data serve essentially the same purpose, for simplicity we will use the term \"cookies\" throughout this guide to mean <strong>both</strong> browser cookies <strong>and</strong> web storage data.)</p>\n<p>This guide describes the cookies that the Uberflip platform may create in a visitor's browser when they visit <strong>your web properties</strong> <strong>on which Uberflip-hosted content is present</strong>. It lists all cookies which may be set, and outlines their purposes.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>This reference guide only discusses cookies that are specifically <strong>created by the Uberflip platform</strong>. If you integrate your Uberflip Hubs and other web properties with certain third-party services (such as Marketing Automation Platforms, web analytics services, etc.), these services may create <strong>additional</strong> <strong>cookies not listed on this page</strong> whenever a visitor accesses your Hub content. For more information, please refer to the support resources for each service that you integrate with your Hubs.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How does the Uberflip platform use cookies?</h2>\n<p>The Uberflip platform uses various cookies that can be broadly classified into three categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Essential Functions</strong>: These cookies are essential for making core Uberflip platform functionality work. If these cookies are refused by a visitor, Uberflip-powered websites and their features will not work.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Performance &amp; Functionality</strong>: These cookies support non-essential functionality and enhance the performance of Uberflip-powered websites. The websites will still generally work if these cookies can't be set, although some functionality will become unavailable.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Analytics</strong>: These cookies collect information that is used in aggregate form to power Uberflip's web analytics products (<a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035433571\" target=\"_self\">Uberflip Analytics</a>, Legacy Metrics <em>(discontinued)</em>, and Hub dashboards).</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>When does the Uberflip platform set cookies?</h2>\n<p>In general, the Uberflip platform will set cookies whenever a visitor accesses any type of web content that is hosted on the Uberflip platform (though not all cookies may be set in every situation). This includes Hub content (such as blog posts, etc.), Flipbooks, and any Uberflip-hosted content that is delivered in a non-Hub context. Examples of \"non-Hub contexts\" include embedded Tiles, Streams, and CTAs, or <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022595791\" target=\"_self\">Site Engager</a>, on your non-Uberflip web properties.</p>\n<p> Examples of situations where the Uberflip platform will set cookies include:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>When a visitor views any page in a Hub</li>\n<li>When a visitor views a Flipbook</li>\n<li>When a visitor accesses a (non-Hub) domain on which Site Engager is being used</li>\n<li>When a visitor views a (non-Hub) webpage or email where embedded content is displayed</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What HTTP cookies does the Uberflip platform create?</h2>\n<p>The following table lists all HTTP cookies that may be created by the Uberflip platform:</p>\n<table class=\"table table--bordered\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 153.5px;\"><strong>Name</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 153.5px;\"><strong>Type</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 153.5px;\"><strong>Expires</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 153.5px;\"><strong>Purpose</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 153.5px;\"><em>_MGZ_</em></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 153.5px;\">Essential Functions</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 153.5px;\">Session</td>\n<td style=\"width: 153.5px;\">Used to distinguish the sessions of different users, required for core platform functionality.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 153.5px;\"><em>uiState</em></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 153.5px;\">Performance &amp;

Web storage has several advantages over cookies, such as improved security and better website performance. If you'd like to learn more about HTML5 Web Storage, see <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp\">this page</a>.</p>\n<p>Web storage provides two <em>objects</em> in which data can be stored in a user's browser: <code class=\"no-padding\">window.localStorage</code> and <code class=\"no-padding\">window.sessionStorage</code>. The Uberflip platform uses <strong>only</strong> the <code class=\"no-padding\">window.sessionStorage</code> object. This means that the data it creates in web storage expires (and is deleted) whenever the user closes the relevant browser tabs/windows.</p>\n<p>The following table lists all web storage entries that may be created by the Uberflip platform:</p>\n<table class=\"table table--bordered\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 156.25px;\"><strong>Name</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 156.25px;\"><strong>Type</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 156.25px;\"><strong>Expires</strong></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 156.25px;\"><strong>Purpose</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 156.25px;\"><em>_ufaw_</em></td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 156.25px;\">Analytics</td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 156.25px;\">Session</td>\n<td style=\"width: 156.25px;\"> Used to distinguish users of the platform for Uberflip Analytics during a single session on the platform.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>More than one entry of <em>_ufaw_</em> may be created, in the format of <code class=\"no-padding\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">_ufaw_&lt;unique identifier&gt;_&lt;unique identifier&gt;</span></code> (e.g. <code class=\"no-padding\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">_ufaw_fc5b7adcb5c14c7ba967488c6d8a51fb_8e1b85fe1d774de49b6092ae03089cc7</span></code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Do Uberflip platform cookies store personal data?</h2>\n<p>The Uberflip platform uses cookies which store random identifiers only. Cookies used by the Uberflip platform do not contain any type of information that can identify an individual, such as data sourced from Form CTAs, connected Marketing Automation Platforms, or any other connected systems. As a result, these cookies can distinguish between individual users, but can not alone identify them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How do Uberflip platform cookies work with Uberflip's privacy features?</h2>\n<p>If you use the built-in <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020222171\">Uberflip privacy features</a> (<em>Privacy Policy Page</em> and <em>Privacy Banner</em>) that are controlled by the <em>Privacy Groups</em> system, <strong>cookies set by the Uberflip platform all fall under the default \"Uberflip\" functionality</strong>. As a result, they will be associated with the Privacy Group to which you have assigned the \"Uberflip\" functionality, and Uberflip platform cookies will be set only if and when a visitor opts into this Privacy Group.</p>"

There are two reason for this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The data collection system for Uberflip Analytics was activated in July 2019, so it has only been able to collect data since this date. Because our old system for gathering data works very differently, the data collected for legacy Metrics isn't compatible with Uberflip Analytics, and can't be used to backfill data for dates earlier than July 2019. As a result, Uberflip Analytics will never contain metrics data for dates prior to July 2019. Yearly comparisons of data will therefore be possible once at least one year has passed, i.e. from July 2020 onward.</li>\n<li>The functionality for quarterly comparisons has not yet been implemented. We expect basic quarter-over-quarter comparisons (using date ranges to select individual quarters for export) to be available by Spring 2020. Our Product team is investigating how we can improve this going forward, and eventually we plan to support built-in quarter-over-quarter functionality.</li>\n</ol>"

            "body": "<h2>Question</h2>\n<p>When I look at the same (or similar) metrics in Uberflip Analytics and legacy Metrics or the Hub dashboards, the numbers are different. Why?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>The short answer is that these metrics are being collected not just differently, but in a way that is a lot more <em>accurate</em>.</p>\n<p>Metrics are based on recording when and how events happen, for example page views. This done by an event collection system, which is responsible for recording and measuring these events, and generating data from them, i.e. metrics.</p>\n<p>For Uberflip Analytics, we completely rebuilt our event collection system from the ground up. As a result, we're now able to test and audit all metrics, which means we can be confident that the numbers shown in Uberflip Analytics are accurate to a much greater degree than what was presented in legacy Metrics.</p>\n<p>On top of this, there are also specific cases where the numbers are different by design. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Changes to how certain metrics are calculated:</strong> For example, Time on Page in Uberflip Analytics is only calculated for Hub content pages, while the same metric in legacy metrics is only calculated for Flipbook pages.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Changes to how date ranges work:</strong> When you select a date range in legacy Metrics, the period includes the end date, but in Uberflip Analytics it does not. For example, a date range of January 15 to February 15 would not include February 15 itself in Uberflip Analytics, but this date would be included in legacy Metrics.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Availability of data</strong>: Some metrics in Uberflip Analytics only started to be collected after a certain date, so data from earlier than that date is not available. See <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038311372\">this article</a> for information about when data collection started for different metrics.</li>\n</ul>"

            "body": "<h2>Question</h2>\n<p>How is Uberflip Analytics different from Google Analytics?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>Uberflip Analytics and Google Analytics seem like similar tools, but they differ fundamentally in terms of focus and purpose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Analytics is rooted in web page engagement, and is built for the broadest possible audience. It views websites in terms of web pages, not the content they contain, so it can't draw links between pages that contain the same content. For example, if you have a blog post that appears in three different places, Google Analytics simply sees this as three separate pages.</li>\n<li>By contrast, Uberflip Analytics was built with a content-first approach, so it knows that the blog post is the same piece of content in three different places. This helps you to understand how a piece of content is performing across all your web experiences, and ultimately to prove the value of content. Google Analytics <em>could</em> do this with custom filters and events, but that requires development work. With Uberflip Analytics, this capability is available out-of-the-box.</li>\n<li>They two systems are also different in terms of the numbers they display. Although both share certain metrics, you can expect the numbers to be different, because the way each system measures is not the same.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For some concrete examples of how Uberflip Analytics and Google Analytics compare, see the tables below. These focus on two metrics areas that both systems have in common (<em>Tags</em> and <em>Time on Page</em>) and show how they are different:</p>\n<h3>Tags</h3>\n<table style=\"height: 316px; width: 668px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;\" border=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\"> </td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 211.333px;\"><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360047022371/Group_14.png\" alt=\"Group_14.png\" width=\"199\" height=\"64\"></td>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\"> <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360047023631/ga.png\" alt=\"ga.png\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\"><strong>Tag Collection<br></strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\">Add tags at any time</td>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\">Tags must be on-page at time of pageview for data to be collected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\"><strong>Tag Filtering<br></strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\">Built-in filters with advanced logic</td>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\">Creating and applying filters is complex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\"><strong>Tag Reporting<br></strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\">Built-in reports and flexibility to easily author your own</td>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\">Difficult to create roll-up tag reports and get tags in data exports</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2> </h2>\n<h2>Time on Page</h2>\n<table style=\"height: 316px; width: 668px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;\" border=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\"> </td>\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"width: 211.333px;\"><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360047022371/Group_14.png\" alt=\"Group_14.png\" width=\"199\" height=\"64\"></td>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\"> <img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360047023631/ga.png\" alt=\"ga.png\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\"><strong>Time on Page Collection<br></strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\">Can track tab in focus, resumed viewing, and single page</td>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\">Time on Page requires a page transition, so can't track single page or last page</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\"><strong>Time on Page Reporting<br></strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\">Aggregates across Items, Streams and Tags, and can drill to a single visitor/page view</td>\n<td style=\"width: 211.333px;\">Only shows Time on Page for a single URL</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"

Although Flipbooks have their own SEO settings, <strong>using these settings usually won't give you the best results</strong>. In this article we'll explain why, and show you the key best practices we've learned for optimizing Flipbooks content for search.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Best Practice 1: Serve Flipbooks as Hub Items</h2>\n<p>We created Flipbooks before Uberflip Hubs came along, so they were designed to <strong>serve your PDF content directly</strong>. This meant that, if a Flipbook showed up on Google, clicking on it would simply open that content in the Flipbook viewer right away.</p>\n<p>That was fine at the time, but now there is a better way: <strong>serve Flipbooks through your Hub</strong>,<strong> by</strong> <strong>automatically</strong> <strong>embedding them in Hub Items</strong>. Doing this will allow you to <strong>better leverage the often high-value content that your Flipbooks represent</strong>.</p>\n<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>\n<p>There are a few benefits to embedding Flipbooks in Hub Items, rather than making them directly accessible. You can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Gate Flipbooks with <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020989871\" target=\"_self\">Form CTAs</a>:</strong> When you embed a Flipbook in an Item, you can place a Form CTA on the Flipbook that visitors must interact with before they can access the content. This allows you to leverage your high-value Flipbook content to help generate leads.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Recommend related content:</strong> When you make Flipbook content part of your Hub, you can use <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022410572\" target=\"_self\">Content Recommendations</a> to recommend other content that visitors might be interested in. This keeps visitors interacting with your content for longer, raising their engagement.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Improve SEO</strong>: There are far more <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028437152\" target=\"_self\">SEO options</a> available to you through your Hub than with Flipbooks alone, so Flipbooks embedded in Hub Items can potentially rank much better.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Do This:</strong></h4>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>\n<strong>Add Flipbook Streams to your Hub, one for each Flipbook Folder you have.</strong> Each Flipbook Stream you add will automatically create individual Items for every Flipbook in the specified Folder.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these Items have been created, you can <strong>flesh them out with blog content</strong> for SEO (<a href=\"#h_09efc554-e4a7-4ece-9701-baa15ce39840\" target=\"_self\">see below</a>) and <strong>add Form CTA gates</strong>, <strong>enable Content Recommendations</strong>, and so on. When a Flipbook Item is ready, you can publish it like any other Item in your Hub, and add it to your Marketing and Sales Streams.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Best Practice 2: Block Flipbook Indexing</h2>\n<p>After you've set up your Flipbooks to be served as Hub Items, you have to <strong>make sure this is the only way to access them</strong>. To do that, you need to change your Flipbook SEO settings to <strong>block indexing of the direct Flipbook URL</strong>.</p>\n<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>\n<p>Flipbooks have their own SEO settings, separate from those in your Hub. One of these settings is <em>Block search engines from indexing my content</em>, which is <strong>turned off by default</strong>. As a result, search engines <strong>can index the direct URL for Flipbooks</strong>, and the direct version of a Flipbook can appear in search results alongside the Hub Item version. This means that, if the Hub Item version is gated with a CTA, visitors could simply <strong>bypass the CTA</strong> by going to the direct version instead. For this reason, you should make sure to <strong>turn on this setting</strong> so that the direct version is not indexed.</p>\n<p>Another reason to block indexing of Flipbooks is that it's unreliable: Flipbooks have a <strong>separate URL for every page in the Flipbook</strong>, and Google can choose to <strong>index the URL for whichever page it deems most relevant</strong>. When this happens, clicking on the Flipbook in search results will take visitors to somewhere in the middle of the Flipbook, not the first page (cover) — not an ideal content experience.</p>\n<h4><strong>Do This:</strong></h4>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Open your Flipbook SEO settings by going to <em>Flipbooks &gt; </em>select a <em>Folder &gt; </em><em>Edit &gt;</em><em> Basics &gt; Search Engine Optimization. </em><strong>Make sure that the setting </strong><em>Block search engines from indexing my content </em><strong>is</strong> <strong>checked </strong>(remember to click the <strong>Save</strong> button to apply the change):<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360047720671/Edit_an_existing_Folder_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Edit_an_existing_Folder_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This a Folder-specific setting, so <strong>you will need to</strong> <strong>change it separately for every Flipbooks Folder</strong> you have. Also, making this change will override any other SEO settings you might have previously configured here (e.g. keywords), so you don't need to worry about changing them. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_09efc554-e4a7-4ece-9701-baa15ce39840\">Best Practice 3: Write search-optimized content for your Flipbook Hub Items</h2>\n<p>Now that you are serving up your Flipbooks through Hub Items, you need to <strong>work on the Item content</strong> <strong>to optimize it for search engine</strong><strong>s</strong>. That means <strong>writing engaging content for the Item itself</strong>, as well as <strong>applying <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028437152\">SEO best practices</a></strong>.</p>\n<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>\n<p>When you create a Flipbook Stream, every Item in that Stream is basically a blank blog post with an embedded Flipbook. <strong>Search engines can't see the contents of the Flipbook</strong>, so unless you add some content in the blog post itself, <strong>the Item will just look like an empty page </strong>from Google's perspective. If you want the Hub Items containing your Flipbooks to rank well, you'll need to add some search-optimized content.</p>\n<h4><strong>Do This:</strong></h4>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>\n<strong>Treat your Flipbook Items like you would any other blog post:</strong> create quality content for them that can stand on its own.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Google needs to consider the content of these Items good enough to rank all by itself, as if the Flipbook wasn't there. At minimum, it needs to be <strong>long enough so that it's clearly real content</strong> (rather than just a bunch of keywords). As a general rule, we recommend aiming for <strong>no less than five paragraphs</strong>. Use the opportunity to write content that gets the reader excited about reading your Flipbook — and therefore more likely to submit your Form CTA, if the Flipbook is gated.</p>\n<p>You should also ensure that this content is <strong>optimized for search engines</strong>. Remember to <strong>apply the usual SEO best practices</strong>: identify the <strong>keywords</strong> you want to target and include them in your body text and headings; add <strong>meta descriptions</strong>, etc. Don't forget to <strong>leverage Uberflip's <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028437152\" target=\"_self\">built-in SEO functionality</a></strong>.</p>"

If not, please create the Stream and add content to it before proceeding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About Stream Sections</h2>\n<h3>What This Hub Hack Does</h3>\n<p>In certain Streams, it can sometimes make sense to divide the content into sections to make it easier for visitors to navigate.</p>\n<p>For example, in the <a href=\"https://academy.uberflip.com/\">Uberflip Academy</a>, we have a number of training videos that cover various aspects of setting up your Uberflip Hub. The videos are all within a single Stream so that they're easy to browse, but they're also logically organized around the stages of the <a href=\"https://hub.uberflip.com/blog/the-content-experience-framework\">Content Experience Framework</a>: some videos relate to centralizing content, others to personalizing experiences, and so on.</p>\n<p>We wanted to make it clear which videos related to each stage, so we split the Stream into sections that correspond to these stages, as you can see below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360063732652/Platform_Training_Videos.jpg\" alt=\"Platform_Training_Videos.jpg\"></p>\n<p>If you have a similar use case in your Hub, you can use the Hub Hack described in this article to create your own sectioned Streams.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_d69946af-49df-4404-8d14-e641e9a371c8\">How It Works</h3>\n<p>As with all Hub Hacks, Stream sections are primarily driven by custom code snippets that you'll add to your Hub. But because Uberflip doesn't have a built-in way to create \"dividers\" between content Items, you'll also need to do some additional setup work to achieve this effect. Specifically, you'll need to create:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Link CTAs for every section heading you need</li>\n<li>A special placeholder Item in a dedicated Stream</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's how it works:</p>\n<p>To create the section headings in the Stream, you will use specially-formatted <strong>Link CTAs</strong>. Each section heading will be represented by a single Link CTA, and the <em>Tagline/Copy</em> text that you set on the CTA will be used as the section heading text that is displayed within the Stream. For example, this Link CTA:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360044432832/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"171\" height=\"218\"></p>\n<p>Will look like this when used as a section heading in a Stream:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360044511591/Stream_Sectioning_Example.png\" alt=\"Stream_Sectioning_Example.png\" width=\"568\" height=\"198\"></p>\n<p>Once created, you can simply put these Link CTAs anywhere within the Stream that you want to place a section heading.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>Because this Hub Hack uses Link CTAs to create section headings, it's subject to a Link CTA-related limitation: all Link CTAs <strong>must</strong> be placed within the first 20 Items in a Stream.</p>\n<p>This means that, although you can use this Hub Hack on Streams with any number of Items, your <strong>last</strong> section heading must appear <strong>before the 20th Item </strong>in the Stream (or earlier). In other words, you will not be able to place any section headings after the 20th Item.</p>\n</div>\n<p>You will also need to create a <strong>placeholder Item in a dedicated Stream</strong>. This placeholder Item is needed as a workaround for a placement problem: the Link CTA that represents the first section heading needs to be placed <em>before</em> the first content Item, but a CTA can't be in first position in a Stream. To get around this, you use the placeholder Item to occupy first position in the Stream, with the first section heading CTA in second position, like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360044521151/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>Because the placeholder Item will be hidden with custom code, the CTA in second position will effectively be in first position when the Stream is viewed — putting the first section heading at the top of the page, with no Items above it.</p>\n<p>The placeholder Item also serves a second purpose by <strong>functioning as the \"on switch\" for this Hub Hack</strong>. When you add the placeholder Item to any Marketing Stream, the custom code will look for the specially-formatted Link CTAs within that Stream, and will display them as section headings if they're present. This makes it easy to create additional sectioned Streams later.</p>\n<p> When you're ready to get started, follow the steps below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 1: Create a Placeholder Item in a Dedicated Stream</h2>\n<p>To get started, <strong>create a new Blog Stream</strong>, then <strong>create the placeholder Item inside this Stream</strong>. The placeholder Item will be hidden by custom code, and you will use it to enable sections on any Marketing Stream of your choice by simply adding it to the Stream. For details on why this placeholder Item is needed, <a href=\"#h_d69946af-49df-4404-8d14-e641e9a371c8\" target=\"_self\">see above</a>.</p>\n<p>For this guide, we will assume you are familiar with Blog Streams and Items, and will not provide step-by-step guidance on how to create a Stream or Item. For detailed instructions, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025342851\" target=\"_self\">this article</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>You must create a <strong>new</strong> <strong>Stream</strong>, and this Stream should <strong>contain</strong> <strong>ONLY the placeholder Item</strong>. There are a few reasons for this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It's <strong>cleaner</strong>: having the placeholder Item in a dedicated Stream makes it easier for others to understand and modify this setup later</li>\n<li>The Stream itself must be <strong>hidden</strong> and must <strong>not be indexable</strong>, so it can't be used for anything else</li>\n<li>The custom code snippet that powers this Hub Hack <strong>hides all content from this Stream</strong>, so any other Items you add to it will be invisible everywhere</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li> Log in to your Uberflip account and navigate to the Hub with the Stream to which you want to add sections.</li>\n<li>To begin, <strong>create a new Blog Stream</strong>.\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you choose the <em>\"Start from scratch\"</em> option when creating the Stream.</li>\n<li>We recommend calling this Stream something that clearly indicates its purpose, such as \"Stream Sections Placeholder Stream\", and briefly describing this purpose in the Stream description.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Once the new Stream has been created, <strong>open it</strong>.

You'll need to <strong>create one Link CTA for every section heading</strong> you want to use.</p>\n<p>For this guide, we will assume you are familiar with Link CTAs and will not provide step-by-step guidance on how to create them. For detailed instructions, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020735012\" target=\"_self\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p>Configure each Link CTA as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the <strong>CTA name</strong>, choose any name you want (it will not be displayed in the Stream, only in the CTA Manager). We suggest indicating the Stream that this CTA will be used in in the name field.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360044961611/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"428\" height=\"33\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Layout tab &gt; Tagline/Copy</strong><strong>:</strong> Type the <strong>heading text you want to use</strong>.\n<ul>\n<li>This is the text that will actually be displayed as a heading when the CTA is placed in the Stream.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360044961631/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"541\" height=\"91\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Layout tab &gt; Button label</strong>: Type in <strong>section</strong><em>. </em>\n<ul>\n<li>This must be <strong>only</strong> the word \"section\", in lowercase, and nothing else. This text is what identifies the Link CTA as a section heading to the custom code, and is not displayed.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360044867372/Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Call-to-Action_Configuration_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"539\" height=\"63\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Layout tab &gt; Link Action</strong>: Type in any website URL you want.\n<ul>\n<li>This URL is not displayed anywhere, but you must enter something.

The design of the CTAs is unimportant (as they will not be displayed as CTA tiles), and you will take care of placement in the next step.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After creating all the necessary section heading Link CTAs, proceed to the next step.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_08ee3135-5911-4164-9da1-b177bf1b0df6\">Step 4: Add Placeholder Item and Link CTAs to Stream</h2>\n<p>The last step is to add the placeholder Item and the section heading Link CTAs to the Marketing Stream that you want to divide into sections.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Marketing Stream that you want to divide into sections.</li>\n<li>First, <strong>add the placeholder Item</strong> to the Stream and <strong>drag-and-drop it into first position</strong> in the Stream:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360044868532/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"586\" height=\"377\">\n</li>\n<li>Now, <strong>click on the <em>CTA</em> button</strong> in the menu bar to <strong>add the first section heading CTA t</strong>o the Stream:<strong><br></strong><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360044962691/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>In the menu that appears, find the Link CTA that represents the <strong>first</strong><strong> section heading </strong>— the topmost section heading that should appear on the page.</li>\n<li>In the lower half of the menu, <strong>check the box next to <em>Appears After Item</em></strong>, and make sure the number in the field is set to <strong>1</strong>. Also, make sure the box next to <em>Repeat After Every </em>is <strong>not </strong>checked.<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360044868932/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" width=\"435\" height=\"488\">\n</li>\n<li>Close this menu and <strong>refresh the page</strong> (using your browser's <em>Refresh</em> button). The Link CTA should now appear in the Stream view in the second position (after the placeholder Item):<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360044869052/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Click on the <em>Open </em>button</strong> in the menu bar to preview the Stream. If everything is working correctly, you should see the section heading appear above all content Items in the Stream:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360044869492/Stream_Sections_Example.png\" alt=\"Stream_Sections_Example.png\"><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Not working?

Make sure to <strong>adjust the number beside <em>Appears After Item</em></strong> to place the section heading in the right place in the Stream.</li>\n<li>Once you've added all section headings in the right places, you're done!</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>Before placing the additional section heading Link CTAs (after the first one), <strong>count the number of Items</strong> that should appear before each section heading, so that you know what to enter into the <em>Appears After Item</em> fields. When counting, remember to <strong>count the placeholder Item</strong>, but <strong>not the first section heading Link CTA</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_5e0a823e-2086-437a-97e6-735a541b0a03\">Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>In case it's not working as expected, here are a few things to check:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>Is the placeholder Item <strong>published</strong>? It must not be in draft status.</li>\n<li>Is the placeholder Item <strong>set to \"Show\"</strong>? It must not be set to \"Hide\" under <em>Metadata tab &gt; Status</em>.</li>\n<li>Is the placeholder Item <strong>in first position in the Stream</strong>? It must be in first position to ensure everything is placed correctly, and the first section heading appears at the top of the page.</li>\n<li>Are <strong>both</strong> custom code blocks <strong>enabled</strong>? Both blocks must be enabled for the code within to be active.</li>\n<li>Have you chosen the correct <strong>placements</strong> for the custom code blocks? The CSS block must be set to <em>Head</em> and the JS block must be set to <em>Body Botto</em><em>m</em>.</li>\n<li>Did you specify the correct <strong>Item ID and</strong> <strong>Stream ID</strong> in the CSS custom code block, and the <strong>Item ID </strong>in the JS custom code block? The Item ID and Stream ID specified must be the correct ones for the placeholder Item in the dedicated Stream.</li>\n<li>Are the Item ID and Stream ID <strong>in the right places?</strong> Make sure they aren't switched — the Item ID is a longer string of digits.</li>\n<li>Do all the section heading Link CTAs have <strong>only <em>section</em></strong> set as the <em>Button label</em>? The text you type in here must only be <em>section</em>, lowercase, and nothing else.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>Now that you've done all the setup work and created your first sectioned Stream, it's easy to create additional sectioned Streams at any time. All you need to do is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add the placeholder Item to any Marketing Stream to enable sections</li>\n<li>Create Link CTAs for each section heading you need</li>\n<li>Add the Link CTAs to the Stream to place the section headings</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In other words, from now on, you only need to complete <a href=\"#h_bc124af3-695b-4713-bf92-6c639c2fc817\" target=\"_self\">Step 3</a> and <a href=\"#h_08ee3135-5911-4164-9da1-b177bf1b0df6\" target=\"_self\">Step 4</a> in this guide anytime you want to create sections in any new or existing Marketing Stream.</p>"

For example, if a visitor goes to your Hub and your main website in a single session, page views from both would be recorded in that session, and therefore included in the segment.</p>\n<p>As a result, segments aren't well suited for the purpose of separating your Hub and main website data, and we recommend using a dedicated <strong>view </strong>with a filter instead.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Create a Hub-Only Filtered View in Google Analytics</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/\">Google Analytics account</a>.

Each Hub must have a <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020065732\" target=\"_self\">Hub Locale</a> set.</li>\n<li>Access to this feature is controlled by the <strong>Update Language Links</strong> and <strong>List and Export Language Links</strong> permissions. These permissions are found under the following parent permissions:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Hub &gt; Language Links</em>: Controls Hub-level links</li>\n<li>\n<em>Streams &gt; Native Streams</em>: Controls Stream-level links for Source Streams</li>\n<li>\n<em>Streams &gt; Marketing Streams</em>: Controls Stream-level links for Marketing Streams</li>\n<li>\n<em>Streams &gt; Sales Streams</em>: Controls Stream-level links for Sales Streams</li>\n<li>\n<em>Items</em>: Controls Item-level links</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>By default, the permissions necessary to use this feature are granted to all users in the <strong>Account Administrators</strong> and <strong>Content Managers</strong> user groups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About Multi-Language Links</h2>\n<h3>Hreflang Tags</h3>\n<p>Whenever you create content that is localized for particular languages and regions, it's important to set <strong>hreflang tags</strong> on those pages. An hreflang tag is an HTML attribute that tells search engines what language a page is in, and which <em>other</em> languages that same page is also available in (and where to find them). Hreflang tags are crucial for SEO: they help to surface your content for people searching in particular languages, and they prevent duplicate content issues.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Info</h4>\n<p>If you'd like to learn more about hreflang tags and how they impact your SEO, check out <a href=\"https://moz.com/learn/seo/hreflang-tag\">this helpful article from Moz</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In Uberflip, you set hreflang tags by creating <strong>Multi-Language Links</strong>. Multi-Language Links allow you to link pages across your Hubs into groups, with each group representing all the localized variations of a given page. For example, if you had Hubs in English, French, and Spanish, you could link their individual Hub home pages into a group to signify that they are all translated versions of the same Hub home page.</p>\n<p>Whenever you link a group of pages with Multi-Language Links, Uberflip automatically sets the appropriate hreflang tags on all pages in the group. In that example above, the relevant hreflang tags would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"https://french.example.com/\" hreflang=\"fr-ca\" /&gt;<br>&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"https://spanish.example.com/\" hreflang=\"es-es\" /&gt;<br>&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"https://english.example.com/\" hreflang=\"en-us\" /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>These tags tell search engines that these three pages are alternate versions of one another, which language each alternate version is in, and where to find each one.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_b5958c62-0a4f-4e50-ad6f-1a657afa9b16\">Locale Selector</h3>\n<p>In addition to setting hreflang tags, creating Multi-Language Links also gives you the option of displaying the <strong>Locale Selector </strong>on your Hubs. This is a language selection menu that allows visitors to switch between linked translations of a page:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360041682851/Fullscreen_2019-10-28__4_40_PM.png\" alt=\"Fullscreen_2019-10-28__4_40_PM.png\" width=\"570\" height=\"179\"></p>\n<p>The language menu is dynamic, so it appears only on pages with linked translations, and automatically adjusts the options that are shown based on their availability for the current page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_b5958c62-0a4f-4e50-ad6f-1a657afa9b16\">Contextual Linking</h3>\n<p>If a visitor switches languages, Multi-Language Links can also <strong>preserve the Stream context of Items</strong>. For example, say a visitor enters an English-language Marketing Stream and views an Item, then switches their language to Spanish. In this case, you would want to send them to the Spanish-language version of the Item, ideally in the context of <em>that same Marketing Stream</em>. We call this <strong>contextual linking</strong>, and as long as you have linked the two Marketing Streams in addition to the Items, Multi-Language Links is smart enough to do this automatically.</p>\n<p>Here's how contextual linking works:</p>\n<p>If <strong>you only link the Items</strong>, but <strong>not the Marketing Streams</strong>, the visitor would be taken to the Spanish-language version of the Item <strong>in its Source Stream</strong>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360041776372/Multi_Lang_Contextual_Linking_-_draw_io.png\" alt=\"Multi_Lang_Contextual_Linking_-_draw_io.png\" width=\"401\" height=\"283\"></p>\n<p>But if you <strong>also link the corresponding Marketing Streams</strong>, Multi-Language links knows that the linked Items appear in both Streams, and will automatically take the visitor to the Item <strong>in the Spanish-language version of the linked Marketing Stream</strong>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360041776432/Multi_Lang_Contextual_Linking_-_draw_io.png\" alt=\"Multi_Lang_Contextual_Linking_-_draw_io.png\" width=\"401\" height=\"284\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In other words, Multi-Language Links' contextual linking feature makes it easy to ensure that visitors can consume your content in the context you intended — even if they land on the \"wrong\" language and need to switch.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_4fc1af9a-201b-4afa-803a-0fd8fc120f94\">Create Multi-Language Links</h2>\n<p>Here are some basic guidelines to keep in mind when you create Multi-Language Links:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\n<li>You can create Multi-Language Links at all levels (<strong>Hub</strong>, <strong>Stream</strong>, and <strong>Item</strong>). Because links are intended to indicate that the linked pages are alternate versions of one another, links must be between pages <strong>at the same level</strong> as one another, i.e. Hub-to-Hub, Stream-to-Stream, or Item-to-Item.</li>\n<li>In Uberflip, the <strong>Hub Locale</strong> is used as the basis of localization: a Hub's Locale specifies the language of that Hub, and all the Streams and Items within it. As a result, links between Streams and between Items are always <strong>across Hubs</strong> — it's not possible to link Streams or Items within the same Hub.</li>\n<li>For the same reason, you can only link Hubs, Streams, or Items that have <strong>different Hub Locales</strong>. Each page in a group of linked pages represents a single localized version, so no two can be set to the same Hub Locale. Note that this applies to Hub Locales, <strong>not</strong> languages: regional variations of the same language that have their own Hub Locale setting (e.g. <em>English (United States) </em>and <em>English (United Kingdom)</em>) can have Hub/Stream/Item links between them.</li>\n<li>Links created at any level exist independently of links at all other levels. This means that you can create links between Items without needing to link the Streams they belong to, or the Hubs that they are in. Likewise, you can link Streams even if no link exists between their Hubs. In addition, removing a link at a higher level does not affect any of the links below it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn how to create links at each level, click on the tabs below:</p>\n<div class=\"tabs\">\n<div class=\"tabs-menu\">\n<span class=\"tabs-link is-active\">Link Hubs</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Link Streams</span> <span class=\"tabs-link\">Link Items</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab\">\n<p>Multi-Language Links between <strong>Hubs</strong> link their individual <strong>Hub home pages</strong>. When you link Hubs, this will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create hreflang tags on all of the linked Hub home pages (pointing to one another as alternates)</li>\n<li>Display the <a href=\"#h_8d468c13-07cc-4ec4-9441-4da814dc8ca9\" target=\"_self\">Locale Selector</a> on the linked Hub home pages (only on Hubs where the feature is enabled).</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>You can also create <strong>distinct</strong> <strong>groups of linked Hubs</strong>, which can be useful if you have multiple \"types\" of Hubs with different audiences and purposes.</p>\n<p>For example, say you have an \"Education\" Hub type and a \"Resources\" Hub type, and each type has localized versions in several languages: in this case, you could link all of the <em>Education</em> Hubs together in one group, and all of the <em>Resources</em> Hubs together in a separate group.</p>\n<p>When creating groups in this way, keep in mind that they must be completely distinct — no Hub can be in more than one group.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>To create Multi-Language Links between Hubs:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Uberflip account.</li>\n<li>Using the <strong>Hubs</strong> menu at the top, navigate to <strong>one</strong> of the Hubs that you want to link.\n<ul>\n<li>When creating a new group of linked Hubs, you can go to <strong>any</strong> of the Hubs that you plan to link together — you do not have to start with any specific Hub.</li>\n<li>If you want to link a new Hub to an <strong>already existing group of linked Hubs</strong>, you can't do this from within the Hub to be added: you must go to a Hub that is already part of the group.</li>\n<li>The Hub you choose (and all Hubs it will be linked with) must have a <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020065732\" target=\"_self\">Hub Locale</a> set.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In the sidebar menu on the left, click on <strong>Hub Options &gt; Multi-Language</strong>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Hub Links for [Hub Name]</strong> menu will appear on the right.

            "body": "<h2>Objective</h2>\n<p>The customer wants to use a custom domain for their Hub that is not part of any existing domain. This means that the domain they want:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does not include a subdirectory (not Hubs-on-Dubs)</li>\n<li>Does not include \"www\" or any other subdomain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The typical use case in this situation is that <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033186892\">the customer wants their Hub to be a standalone website <strong>and</strong> to eliminate \"www\" from the URL</a>, e.g . they want a URL for their Hub to be a naked/bare/root domain like <code class=\"no-padding\">https://myhub.com/</code>.</p>\n<p>Unlike a <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018786372\" target=\"_self\">normal subdomain Hub</a>, a customer can't set this up by themselves, so an Uberflipper will need to help them complete the process. This article outlines what you need to do.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Prerequisite: Advise the Customer to Contact Their DNS Provider</h2>\n<p>To set up a standalone custom domain like this, the customer must be able to create an <a href=\"https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/alias-record/\"><strong>ALIAS record</strong></a> (not to be confused with an A record) with their DNS provider. This is a newer type of DNS record that may not be supported by all DNS providers.</p>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should ask the customer to contact their DNS provider and ask if they can create ALIAS records (again, this is <strong>not</strong> the same as an A record). You can proceed only if this is possible. (Note also that some DNS providers may use a different name for this type of record.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 1: Create the Custom Domain</h2>\n<p>The customer can complete this step themselves, but it's recommended that you do so for them. This is because the domain <em>must</em> initially be created with \"www\" (which is only removed in Step 2), which can be confusing for the customer.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p>You must create the domain from within the customer's Hub, <strong>not</strong> using the internal Uberflip Admin backend: if you use the Admin backend, it will not be possible to enable SSL on the domain.</p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to the customer's Hub as an admin.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <em>Account Settings &gt; Services &gt; Domains</em> and click on <strong>Add a Domain</strong> to create a new domain.<br>\n<ul>\n<li>For detailed instructions, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018786372\">this article</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Although the customer wants a URL <strong>without</strong> \"www\", make sure to <strong>include \"www\" when creating the domain</strong>, as the tool will reject any URL without a subdomain.\n<ul>\n<li>e.g. if the customer wants <code class=\"no-padding\">https://myhub.com/</code>, you must create <code class=\"no-padding\">https://<strong>www</strong>.myhub.com/</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When you have created the domain in the customer's account, move on to the next step.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 2: Open an Ops Ticket</h2>\n<p>Since you had to create the custom domain with \"www\" in it, an Ops ticket is necessary to remove it from the domain.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to <a href=\"https://uberflip.atlassian.net/\">Jira</a>.</li>\n<li>On the left, click on the + button.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Create issue</strong> window that appears, choose <strong>\"Infra/Ops (OPS)\"</strong> under <strong>Project</strong>.</li>\n<li>Fill in the <strong>Summary</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> fields, leaving everything else as default (including blanks):\n<ul>\n<li>For <strong>Summary</strong>, enter something like \"Remove www. from custom domain\"</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Description field</strong>, provide details about the customer and domain that.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Create</strong>. Ops will notify you once the custom domain has been modified as requested<strong>.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Once you have confirmation from Ops, proceed to the next step.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 3: Ask the Customer to Create an ALIAS Record</h2>\n<p>At this stage, you can notify the customer that they can now update their DNS to point the custom domain at <em>read.uberflip.com</em>, as per <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018786372\" target=\"_self\">the normal procedure</a>.</p>\n<p>However, there is one important difference: in the normal procedure, a customer would create a <strong>CNAME record</strong>. In this case, that is not possible, as you cannot create CNAME record for a naked domain (a domain without www or any other subdomain).</p>\n<p>Instead, <strong>advise the customer to create an</strong> <strong>ALIAS record</strong>. This is a newer type of DNS record that works like a CNAME record, but can be created for a naked domain. It is otherwise set up exactly the same way as a CNAME record.</p>\n<p>Once this is done, the customer can proceed with the normal subdomain setup procedure to complete the setup.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Additional Notes</h2>\n<p>There are two reasons why this modified process is necessary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All new Hub domains should have SSL, but you can only set up a custom domain with SSL by creating it within the customer's Hub interface. This interface requires a subdomain to successfully create a Hub. As a result, the custom domain must be set up with a subdomain, which we must then manually remove internally.</li>\n<li>The setup process used is the same as for a subdomain, which requires setting up a CNAME record with the customer's DNS provider. CNAME records can't coexist with any other type of records, so they can't be created for the root domain (as this would interfere with e.g. the A record for the domain). Instead, an alternative type of record (the ALIAS) record must be used.</li>\n</ul>"

This leads to a circular situation where you need the XML file to get the ACS URL, but need the ACS URL to get the XML file.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Steps to Fix</h2>\n<p>Use the following workaround to resolve this issue:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In your IdP, go through the process of setting up Uberflip as a new site on which you will use SSO (with SAML).</li>\n<li>When you are asked to enter Uberflip's ACS URL, <strong>type in a placeholder value</strong> for now.\n<ul>\n<li>For example, you can use <code class=\"no-padding\">https://app.uberflip.com/sso/saml2/placeholder</code>\n</li>\n<li>The real ACS URL will be in the format <code class=\"no-padding\">https://app.uberflip.com/sso/saml2/12345/123456</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Complete the setup process and <strong>generate the XML metadata file</strong> in your IdP.</li>\n<li>Use the XML metadata file to complete <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020132311\" target=\"_self\">the SSO setup process</a> in Uberflip.</li>\n<li>Once the SSO setup process is complete, return to <strong>Account Settings &gt; Identity Provider Settings</strong> in Uberflip and click on the <strong>Edit </strong>(pencil) button next to the IdP you just set up.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Edit Identity Provider Settings</strong> screen that appears, make sure you're on the <strong>Basic IdP Settings</strong> tab, then scroll down to the <strong>ACS URL</strong> field and copy the value:<br> <strong><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360037351231/Security___Identity_Provider___Edit_Settings_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Security___Identity_Provider___Edit_Settings_-_Uberflip.png\"></strong>\n</li>\n<li>Finally, return to your IdP and open the SSO profile you created for Uberflip. Replace the placeholder value you entered earlier with the real ACS URL you copied.<br>\n<ul>\n<li>In general, you should <strong>not</strong> need to re-generate the XML metadata file.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>"

While this process is used for the majority of Hubs, in some cases it may be necessary to use an alternative process (separate staging Hubs), or to apply changes without staging. In these cases, the process described in this article is not applicable.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>We suggest using <strong>Incognito Mode</strong> in your browser to view your staging Hub. This way, when you exit Incognito Mode, you'll be back in the live version of your Hub automatically in your regular browser window.</p>\n<p>If you do use staging in a regular browser window, you can use the steps in the <a href=\"#h_01H914NWT8VB49E7GJC82Z4G7B\" target=\"_self\">Switch back to live</a> section to exit staging mode.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>About OnBrand staging</h2>\n<p>When developing and deploying software, it's standard practice to use distinct software <em>environments</em> for different stages in the process. These environments are separate from one another, and allow developers to write and test new code without affecting (and possibly breaking) the software that end users interact with (known as the <em>production environment</em>).</p>\n<p>One type of environment that is commonly used is the <strong>staging environment</strong>, which is a duplicate of the production environment. The purpose of a staging environment is to allow stakeholders to try out changes in the software in a way that closely resembles the final experience, but without any risk to the production environment.</p>\n<p>For this reason, Uberflip's OnBrand team uses a staging version of your Hub when deploying customizations you have requested. The staging version incorporates the changes that OnBrand has made, but is otherwise identical to your production Hub. This gives you the opportunity to review and approve the changes before they are pushed to your live Hub.</p>\n<p>In this article, you will learn how you can access the staging version of your Hub, as well as how to switch back to the live version once you've finished reviewing the changes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Uberflip's servers send you the live or staging version of a Hub based on whether or not a cookie exists in your browser. By default, this cookie does not exist, and the server returns the live Hub.</p>\n<p>To <strong>switch to staging</strong>, you simply access your Hub using a modified version of its normal URL. Using this URL sets the staging cookie, and returns the staging version of the Hub at the same time.</p>\n<p>Once the cookie is set, it will remain in your browser until you delete it. This means that you'll remain on the staging version of the Hub, <strong>even if you use your Hub's normal URL</strong> (or your bookmarks). To <strong>switch back to the live Hub</strong>, you must delete the cookie either by using a different modified URL, or by manually deleting your browser cookies.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use an incognito browser window to avoid having to delete the staging cookie when you're done reviewing changes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Switch to staging</h2>\n<p>To switch to the staging version of your Hub, your Onbrand Coordinator will provide the unique query string that can be added to the end of your Hub URL. </p>\n<p>For example, if your Hub URL is:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">https://resources.mycompany.com/</code></p>\n<p>Then the URL to switch to the staging version would be something like:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">https://resources.mycompany.com/?ufcc_onbrand_branch=OB-1234</code></p>\n<p>When you use this modified URL, Uberflip's server will set a cookie in your browser to indicate that you are now on the staging version of the requested Hub. Note that when you use this URL, <strong>the query string will</strong> <strong>disappear</strong> as soon as the page loads. This is intentional: as you have been successfully switched to the staging version of the Hub, the query string is no longer needed.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Important</h4>\n<p><strong>The cookie used to switch to staging will remain in your browser until it is deleted. </strong>As long as the cookie is present, you will be served the staging version of your Hub, <strong>even if you use the normal, unmodified URL</strong>, or browse to different pages in the Hub.</p>\n<p>This only affects <strong>your</strong> browser: any other visitor to your Hub will still see the unchanged, live version of the Hub.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use an incognito browser window to avoid having to delete the staging cookie when you're done reviewing changes.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>The representative of the Onbrand team that's working on your request will provide the special query string/link.</strong> This allows to review changes before they're published to your Hub.</p>\n<p>To request assistance from an Onbrand Development Coordinator, head to <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://help.uberflip.com/\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">https://help.uberflip.com/</a> and select 'Onbrand Request'.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H914NWT8VB49E7GJC82Z4G7B\">Switch back to live</h2>\n<p>Once you have switched to the staging version of your Hub, you will continue to remain on that version <strong>as long as the cookie remains in your browser</strong>.</p>\n<p>To switch back to the live version of your Hub, you need to <strong>delete the cookie </strong>by adding the following query string to the end of your Hub's normal URL: <code class=\"no-padding\">?ufcc_reset</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, if your Hub URL is:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">https://resources.mycompany.com/</code></p>\n<p>Then the URL to switch back to the live version would be something like:</p>\n<p><code class=\"no-padding\">https://resources.mycompany.com/?ufcc_reset</code></p>\n<p>When you visit this URL in our browser, the cookie that switches you to the staging version is deleted, and Uberflip's servers will once again serve the live version of your Hub.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can also simply clear your browser's cookies, which will have the same effect: after you delete your cookies, visiting your Hub's regular URL will once again return the live version.</p>"

To do this, you will need to add the <em>Lead Source</em> field to your Form CTAs as a hidden field, then specify which value you want to write to that field.</p>\n<p>For instructions on how to add the hidden field to your Form CTAs, see this article:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021489991\" target=\"_self\">Use Hidden Fields with Form CTAs</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In <strong>Step 2</strong> of the instructions in the above article, make sure you search for and add the <strong>Lead Source</strong> field</li>\n<li>Once you reach <strong>Step 5</strong>, you can choose whether you want the value to be static (same value every time) or dynamic (value changes depending on context):</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Option 1: Use a Static Lead Source Value</h3>\n<p>If you want to pass a static value to Marketo's <em>Lead Source</em> field every time the Form CTA is submitted, simply enter the desired value into the <strong>Hidden value</strong> text field. You can configure different values for different Form CTAs to differentiate them, or simply specify the same value across all Form CTAs.</p>\n<h3>Option 2: Use a Dynamic Lead Source Value</h3>\n<p>You can also choose to have the <em>Lead Source</em> field value be dynamically populated. The most straightforward way to do this is with query string parameters, where you can set the CTA to adopt the parameter value as the <em>Lead Source</em> field value. For example, if a visitor arrives in your Hub through a URL like</p>\n<pre>resources.mycompany.com/blog/blog-post1?utm_source=<strong>EmailCampaign</strong></pre>\n<p>then <em>EmailCampaign</em> would be passed into Marketo as the value for <em>Lead Source</em> when they submit a Form CTA.</p>\n<p>For instructions on how to set this up, <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021489991-Use-Hidden-Fields-with-Form-CTAs#h_174882557551546554101287\">see this section</a> of the <strong>Use Hidden Fields with Form CTAs</strong> article.</p>\n<p>If you want to do something more complex to dynamically populate the <em>Lead Source </em>field, this would generally require JavaScript. For help, please <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\">contact our Support team</a>, or your Customer Success Manager.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>Remember that you must add the hidden field to every Form CTA you are using in your Hub. If you do not do this for any Form CTA, it will still pass the default Uberflip-specified value to the <em>Lead Source</em> field when it is submitted.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Additional Notes</h2>\n<p>When a Form CTA is submitted, Uberflip will create/update the corresponding lead in the connected Marketo instance, and will populate the <em>Lead Source</em> field with a value in the format <em>UF-CTA-XXXXX-CTAName </em>(if no value exists in that field; Uberflip will not overwrite an existing value). The process described in this article will allow you to specify a value that Uberflip will write to the <em>Lead Source</em> field instead of this default value. This is useful if you use your own format for lead source values, and would like leads created by Uberflip to follow this format.</p>"

But unlike Streams, which are typically intended for fairly wide audiences, Sales Streams are hyper-focused: they are created and personalized for a very specific audience, in many cases just a single person.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, DSRs are primarily intended to be used by your sales team. By giving them access to your content library, along with a fast and convenient way to share that content with their leads and prospects, DSRs enable your sales team to sell more effectively by fostering conversations at all stages of the buyer journey.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How do DSRs work?</h2>\n<h3>Creation</h3>\n<p>You can create DSRs just like a Stream, from the <strong>Content</strong> section of the Uberflip app.  You can also copy a Marketing Stream as the base for a new DSR.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>The best way to create DSRs and do sales engagement is with Sales Assist. Check out the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/categories/360003709111\" target=\"_self\">Sales Assist guides</a> to learn more.</p>\n</div>\n<p>To create and share DSRs in Uberflip, your users must have <strong>their own user account </strong>within your Uberflip account, and must be assigned to the <strong>Sales Reps</strong> user group (or otherwise be manually given the relevant permissions). You can assign as many users to the Sales Reps user group as you have purchased Sales seats (licenses). In addition, <strong>Admins</strong> and <strong>Content Managers</strong> can also create DSRs.</p>\n<p>Creating a DSR <strong>does not count towards your number of Marketing Streams</strong>, and your Sales Reps can create unlimited Sales Streams.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>Existing DSRs can only be viewed by the Sales Rep who created them, and the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018726352\" target=\"_self\">Primary User</a> on the Uberflip account. When viewing a list of Streams, any type of user except the Primary User will only see DSRs that they have created themselves (if any).</p>\n</div>\n<p>For detailed instructions on creating and using DSRs, see <a href=\"#h_73dea419-7af5-4c06-b5f2-79cfdaf1ae49\" target=\"_self\">below</a>.</p>\n<h3>Appearance</h3>\n<p>Like Marketing Streams, DSRs consist of a homepage with a title, an optional description, and at least one Item tile.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360032904071\" alt=\"Hi_John_.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"527\"></p>\n<p>You can also go beyond this default appearance, and further <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020637332-Personalize-a-Marketing-or-Sales-Stream\">personalize a DSR</a> by enhancing it with a customizable banner (and even the prospect organization's logo).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360032740792\" alt=\"Hi_John_.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"673\"></p>\n<h3>Behavior</h3>\n<p>Because DSRs are designed to <strong>privately</strong> share content with a small audience of known individuals, they are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Hidden</strong>: Sales Streams are only accessible through a direct link, and can't be found or viewed by regular visitors to your Hub</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Isolated from your main Hub</strong>: Items within Sales Streams do not link to their original Source Streams</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, clicking on any Item within a DSR will open the content on a new page which is still within the DSR, and there are no links out to the larger Hub (only to other content Items within the same DSR). This ensures that your target leads/prospects with whom you share the DSR are kept within the experience that you have specifically curated for them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_73dea419-7af5-4c06-b5f2-79cfdaf1ae49\">Next steps</h2>\n<p>Ready to create a DSR?

But the Page Replacement tool has some limitations: it can replace pages one-for-one, but it can't add or remove any pages. If your Flipbook is missing pages or has extra pages that you need to remove, you can use the <strong>Replace Flipbook </strong>tool instead.</p>\n<p>Using this tool will cost one upload credit, just like creating a brand-new Flipbook.

Of course, one size doesn't fit all, so you can customize nearly all of these labels to make them consistent with your brand, and the language your company uses.</p>\n<p>To do that, you use the Custom Labels tool. This tool allows you to view all the labels across your Hub and modify them to whatever you want. And, if needed, you can also customize labels specifically at the Stream and Item levels, so that you can set custom labels for specific Streams and Items.</p>\n<p>Custom Labels also works with the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020065732\" target=\"_self\">Hub Locale setting</a> to translate your Hub into other languages. Translations of the default labels are available for a number of languages, and you can customize any of the translated labels to fit your needs. Plus, for languages where no ready-made translation is available yet, you can use Custom Labels to create your own custom translation.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--danger\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Warning</h4>\n<p>If you have previously enabled custom labels or translations on a Hub through OnBrand customizations, you must <strong>disable these customizations before enabling Custom Labels</strong>.

You can translate this label text to another language by changing the Hub Locale:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you change the Hub Locale to a language where a default translation is available (<a href=\"#h_09963153-4d6a-4a08-b8c4-5e3514a9e4dd\" target=\"_self\">see below</a>), all labels will be translated automatically (but you can still customize them with Custom Labels if you want).</li>\n<li>If you change the Hub Locale to a language without a preset translation, you can use Custom Labels to provide your own translations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about Hub Locale and how to set it, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020065732\" target=\"_self\">this article</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_09963153-4d6a-4a08-b8c4-5e3514a9e4dd\">Default translation available</h3>\n<p>Ready-made translations of the default Hub labels are available for the most popular Hub languages. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chinese (Simplified)</li>\n<li>French (Canadian)</li>\n<li>German</li>\n<li>Italian</li>\n<li>Spanish</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you set your Hub Locale to any of these languages, all of the labels will be translated into that language automatically. For example, here is a set of default labels in <strong>English (United States)</strong>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360029112812/Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Labels_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Labels_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>And the same labels when the Hub Locale has been set to <strong>Spanish (Spain)</strong>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360029112792/Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Labels_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Appearance_-_Custom_Labels_-_Uberflip.png\"></p>\n<p>As with the English-language labels, you can also customize the default translations in any way you want.</p>\n<h3>No default translation available</h3>\n<p>If you set your Hub Locale to any language for which a default translation is <strong>not</strong> available, the standard labels will be the same as for <em>English (United States)</em>. For these languages, you can use the Custom Labels tool to translate them manually: simply type the translation into the appropriate Custom Label text box for each label.</p>\n<p>Once you have created custom translations for a given Hub Locale language, the translated labels will be saved to that Hub Locale setting, and can be applied to other Hubs by setting them to that Hub Locale.</p>"

The robots meta directive allows you to influence the behavior of search engine robots, which are the automated systems that analyze (\"crawl\") websites for inclusion in a search engine's results (\"indexing\").</p>\n<p>You'll see one of three statuses under the <em>SEO</em> column for each Stream:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>no-index/follow: </strong>There is a robots meta directive set on the Stream, and it is configured to tell search engines <strong>not</strong> to include (index) the Stream or any Items within it in their search results. The <code class=\"no-padding\">follow</code> part of the tag tells search engines that they can still follow links in the Stream to discover other pages (which might be in a crawlable Stream).\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Corresponding Stream Option: </strong><em>No Robots Meta Tag</em> is set to <strong>off</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>crawlable: </strong>There is <strong>no</strong> robots meta directive set on the Stream. Search engines are able to crawl and index the Stream, and its content will appear in search results for relevant search terms.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Corresponding Stream Option:</strong> <em>No Robots Meta Tag</em> is set to <strong>on</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>crawlable (canonical): </strong>The same as <strong>crawlable</strong>, but \"<a href=\"https://moz.com/learn/seo/canonicalization\">canonical tags</a>\" are also added to all Item pages that belong to the Stream. The canonical tag tells search engines that a page is a duplicate of an original page (and where to find the original) to avoid <a href=\"https://moz.com/learn/seo/duplicate-content\">duplicate content</a> issues. For more details about canonical tags, see <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028437152-SEO-settings-and-best-practices-in-Uberflip#canonical-settings-handle-duplicate-content\">this article</a>.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Corresponding Stream Options: </strong><em>No Robots Meta Tag</em> is set to <strong>on</strong>, <em>Enable Canonical Meta Tag<strong> </strong></em>is set to <strong>on</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can adjust the setting of a Stream’s robots meta directive by using the <strong>No Robots Meta Tag</strong> Stream Option.

Once that is complete, you'll copy the Conversion ID and Conversion label that will be used later on in Google Tag Manager (GTM).</p>\n<p>You can find instructions on how set up conversion tracking in this article from Google:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6095821\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Google: Set up conversion tracking for your website</strong></a></p>\n<p>Follow the instructions in this article until you reach the end of \"Step 1: Create a conversion action\". Then, continue on the next steps in this article.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 1: Configure your Tag in Google Tag Manager (GTM)</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new Google Ads Conversion Tracking tag in GTM and name it anything you'd like.</li>\n<li>Once created, you'll need to define at a minimum the \"Conversion ID\" and the \"Conversion Label\" - these can be found in the campaign you setup for Google Ad Manager for that particular ad.</li>\n<li>Save the tag, we'll being adding a trigger later on. As a placeholder, you can have it fire on all pages for now.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img style=\"display: none !important;\" hidden=\"\" src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360026799391/Google-Ad-Conversion-Tag.png\" alt=\"Google-Ad-Conversion-Tag.png\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 2: Configure your Trigger in GTM</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a \"Custom Event\" type trigger in your GTM container and give it a name.</li>\n<li>In the configuration, add in an Event name, for example: \"ctaConvertedAssetName\" (Note: it's important that this name is unique. The name will also be referenced in a later step in this article, so keep it handy).</li>\n<li>Save the trigger and attach it to the Tag you setup in Step 1.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img style=\"display: none !important;\" hidden=\"\" src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360026795772/Google-Ad-Conversion-Trigger.png\" alt=\"Google-Ad-Conversion-Trigger.png\"></p>\n<h2>Step 3: Configure the Conversion Linker Tag </h2>\n<p>Google suggests adding a Conversion Linker tag to fire on all pages. This is to ensure proper tracking in all browsers. You can find the instructions to set that up <a href=\"https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7549390\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 4: Add gtag.js to your Hub</h2>\n<p>In order for conversion tracking to work, you'll need the global site tag (gtag.js) added to every page of your Hub. To do so, add a code block in your Hub under Appearance &gt; Custom Code. This code block will have the code placed in the &lt;head&gt;.</p>\n<p>Once the code block is created, use the global site tag script from Google's developer documentation <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/\" target=\"_self\">that can be found here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>If you're already tracking page views through our built-in Google Analytics integration, or if you are tracking page views through your Google Tag Manager setup, please ensure that you add a parameter in your gtag.js setup to exclude pageview hits. You can find detailed instructions on how to do this in the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/\">Google documentation</a> linked above.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 5: Pass Data Layer Variable Using Custom Code in your Hub</h2>\n<p>In Step 2, we created a trigger in GTM that is looking for a \"Custom Event\". This next piece of code we'll setup will pass this event name through the data layer and be picked up by your tag and trigger that you setup earlier.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a custom code block in your Hub under <strong>Appearance &gt; Custom Code</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Change the placement of the code block to be inserted in the \"Body Bottom\"</li>\n<li>Add the following code block template seen below:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;<br> (function($,Hubs, undefined){ Hubs.Events.on('ctaFormSubmitSuccess',function(ctaId, ctaData, ctaName){<br> if (ctaId == XXXXXX) {<br> googleAdwords(ctaId, ctaData, ctaName);<br> }<br> }); function googleAdwords(ctaId, ctaData, ctaName){<br> console.log(ctaId);<br> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];<br> window.dataLayer.push({<br> 'event' : 'ctaConvertedAssetName'<br> });<br> }<br> }(window.jQuery, window.Hubs));<br> &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Once that code block is added, you need to swap out two components based on your needs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Where we see -- ctaId == XXXXXX -- you'll want to replace the X's with the 6 digit CTA ID that is being used to track conversions on</li>\n<li>Where we see -- 'ctaConvertedAssetName' -- you'll want to replace that with the name that you gave your \"Custom Event\" trigger in GTM in Step 2 of this article. (Note: the name must match exactly).</li>\n<li>Click \"Save\" on the code block and ensure that it is enabled</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Additional Notes</h2>\n<p>In the above example from Step 5, we are targeting this code to only fire when a certain CTA is submitted. If you'd like, you can setup additional triggers to suit your needs.</p>\n<p>For instance, if you'd like the conversion event to fire when a certain CTA is filled out BUT only on certain URLs, you can edit your tag in Step 1 to include a trigger that is looking for a certain URL path or hostname.</p>"

You can consolidate these pages by switching your \"Primary Dimension\" in Google Analytics to \"Page Title\". Alternatively, if you choose to connect to the built-in Uberflip Google Analytics integration you will want to remove this type of tracking on your Uberflip Hub via Google Tag Manager.</p>\n</div>"

At the end of this article, you'll find <a href=\"#h_9ce31ad0-e066-4da8-a973-6f18b65dc32a\" target=\"_self\">an additional section</a> that details what you need to keep in mind when you add Digesto functionality to further Streams.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_efca44e5-cfad-4c34-a33b-680b83acd4e1\">Prerequisite: Set Up Required Integrations</h2>\n<p>Digesto is a Marketo app, so you need to <strong>integrate Digesto with your Marketo account</strong> before you can begin using it (with Uberflip, or elsewhere).</p>\n<p>You can find instructions on how to do that in this article from Digesto:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://help.digesto.io/en/articles/5305213-step-1-connect-your-marketo-account-to-digesto-via-rest-api\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Digesto: Connect your Marketo account to Digesto via REST API</a></strong></p>\n<p>This also means that, to use Digesto with your Uberflip Hub, <strong>your Hub needs to be integrated with your Marketo account</strong>. Before you can proceed, you'll need to set up this integration if you have not yet done so.</p>\n<p>For detailed instructions on how to set up a Marketo integration with your Hub, see this article:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022063751-Set-Up-a-Marketo-Integration\"><strong>Set Up a Marketo Integration</strong></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_df07de26-98dd-4366-aff0-4f0f7156390a\">Step 1: Create a Static List for Subscribers</h2>\n<p>To hold the email addresses (and other details) of visitors who want to subscribe to a Stream, you need to <strong>create a new Static List</strong> in Marketo. You will later connect this Static List to your Form CTA in Uberflip. As with all Marketo Lists that you use with Uberflip, you <strong>must create this List in the Lead Database section </strong>(not under Marketing Activities).</p>\n<p>For instructions on how to create a Static List in Marketo, see this article from Marketo:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.marketo.com/display/public/DOCS/Create+a+Static+List\" target=\"_self\">Marketo: Create a Static List</a></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_d7fd6c76-fbee-400f-b0af-260b405c3bdc\">Step 2: Create a Form CTA</h2>\n<p>You'll collect subscribers to the Stream using a Form CTA. <strong>Create a new Form CTA</strong> for use with Digesto, and make sure that it is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Connected to<strong> Marketo</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Attached to the<strong> Static List</strong> you created in the previous step</li>\n<li>Only has <strong>one</strong> placement: an <strong>At Stream Level</strong> placement within the Stream you want to allow visitors to subscribe to</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the following article for instructions on how to create and configure the Form CTA:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020989871\" target=\"_self\">Set Up a Form CTA</a></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 3: Get the Stream's RSS Feed</h2>\n<p>Digesto knows when new content has been added to a Stream by monitoring its RSS feed. As a result, you'll need to get the RSS feed for the Stream that you want to let your visitors subscribe to.</p>\n<p>Within your Hub, each individual Stream has its own RSS feed, and you can also get a Hub-wide RSS feed that covers content across all Streams (by default, the <em>Latest Content</em> Items on your Hub homepage). Expand the relevant section below for instructions on how to find the desired type of RSS feed:</p>\n<div class=\"accordion accordion--default\">\n<div class=\"accordion__item\">\n<div class=\"accordion__item-title\"><strong>Get the RSS feed for a Hub (Latest Content)<br></strong></div>\n<div class=\"accordion__item-content\">\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip and navigate to the Hub you want to work with.</li>\n<li>In the top left corner, click on <strong>(RSS)</strong> next to the Hub favicon and name:\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure to click on <strong>(RSS)</strong>, not the domain of the Hub (which appears right next to it).<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360026617391/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip.png\">\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The RSS feed for the Hub will open in a new tab, with a URL like this: <em>https://hub.mywebsite.com/h/feed.rss</em>\n</li>\n<li>This URL represents the RSS feed for the entire Hub. <strong>Copy this URL</strong> so that you can use it in Digesto later.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Note</h4>\n<p>If the <strong>Replace Home Page with a Marketing Stream </strong>setting (Under <strong>Hub Options &gt; Advanced)</strong> is being used, the Hub's RSS feed will include only Items that are in the selected Marketing Stream and are not hidden.</p>\n<p>To get a Hub-level RSS feed that contains Items across all Streams, change this setting back to <strong>Latest Content</strong> (note that this will still only include non-hidden Items).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"accordion__item\">\n<div class=\"accordion__item-title\"><strong>Get the RSS feed for a single Stream<br></strong></div>\n<div class=\"accordion__item-content\">\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Uberflip and navigate to the Hub you want to work with.</li>\n<li>Open the Stream for which you want to get the RSS feed under the <strong>Content</strong> section.</li>\n<li>While viewing the Stream, click on <strong>RSS </strong>in the top right corner:<br><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360026620612/Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip_-__Private_Browsing_.png\" alt=\"Hubs___Manage_-_Uberflip_-__Private_Browsing_.png\" width=\"651\" height=\"299\">\n</li>\n<li>The RSS feed for the Stream will open in a new tab, with a URL like this: <em>https://hub.mywebsite.com/streamname.rss</em>\n</li>\n<li>This URL represents the RSS feed for the selected Stream. <strong>Copy this URL</strong> so that you can use it in Digesto later.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 4: Create a Digest in Digesto</h2>\n<p>Now that you have the RSS feed you need, you can set up the Digest for this Stream in Digesto. Digests are the actual emails that will be sent out to subscribers to notify them of new content in the Stream. As part of creating a Digest, you will specify which RSS feed it should monitor (i.e. the one you just got from your Hub), as well as options like what the email will look like, the schedule on which it is sent, etc.</p>\n<p>For detailed instructions on how to create a Digest, see this article from Digesto:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://help.digesto.io/en/articles/5305208-step-2-create-your-first-digest\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Digesto: Create your first Digest</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_e2576364-b54f-4873-9677-0c1d3321c2dd\">Step 5: Create a Dedicated Marketo Program</h2>\n<p>Digesto requires a dedicated Program in Marketo, so you'll need to <strong>create this Program</strong> next.</p>\n<p>The Digesto-specific Program needs to be configured in a specific way. To create this Program in Marketo, follow the instructions in this article from Digesto:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://help.digesto.io/en/articles/5305199-step-3-create-a-dedicated-marketo-program\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Digesto: Create a dedicated Marketo program</a></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 6: Configure Smart Campaigns in Marketo</h2>\n<p>Almost done! As part of setting up the dedicated Marketo Program for Digesto in the previous step, you will have created two Smart Campaigns: one for testing, and one for production. What you need to do now is configure these Smart Campaigns so that they specifically email subscribers to your Stream (technically, you only need to configure the production Smart Campaign in this way, but we strongly recommending testing your setup first using the testing Smart Campaign).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Begin by setting up the Smart Campaigns as described in Step 4 of <a href=\"https://help.digesto.io/en/articles/5305199-step-3-create-a-dedicated-marketo-program\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">the Digesto article</a>.</li>\n<li>Under the <strong>Smart List</strong> section, add a single <strong>Member of List</strong> filter, and configure it as follows:<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360026647092/Marketo___Digesto_Email_Campaign__Smart_List____Marketing_Activities.png\" alt=\"Marketo___Digesto_Email_Campaign__Smart_List____Marketing_Activities.png\"></p>\n(For <em>Digesto Subscribers</em>, substitute the Static List you created in <a href=\"#h_df07de26-98dd-4366-aff0-4f0f7156390a\" target=\"_self\">Step 1</a>.)</li>\n<li>Continue to configure the Smart Campaign (i.e. Flow, Schedule, etc.) as described in the Digesto article.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's it! The Smart Campaign is now set up in such a way that any visitor who submits the Form CTA on the Stream you chose will be added to the Static List, and will therefore be automatically pulled in to the Smart List on the campaign. The campaign will trigger the Digesto Digest, which will be emailed to your subscribers according to the schedule you set up in Digesto.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_9ce31ad0-e066-4da8-a973-6f18b65dc32a\">Configure Digesto for Additional Streams</h2>\n<p>All of the steps above describe how to set up Digesto to notify subscribers of updates to just one Stream, but you can allow visitors to subscribe to any number of separate Streams in your Hub.</p>\n<p>For each additional Stream that you want enable Digesto on, simply repeat the steps above, with the following adjustments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 1: </strong>Create a new, separate Static List for each individual Stream. As a best practice, give these Static Lists descriptive names that will help you find them later (such as \"XYZ Stream for Digesto\").</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 2: </strong>Create a separate Form CTA for each Stream, and associate it with the Static List dedicated to that Stream's subscribers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 3: </strong>Get the Stream's RSS feed as usual.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 4:</strong> Digests can only be associated with one RSS feed, so you will need to set up separate Digests in Digesto for each individual Stream.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 5: </strong>You do not need to create separate Digesto-specific Programs in Marketo for additional Streams. Instead, add a new Smart Campaign to the existing Program for each Stream you want to add.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 6: </strong>When you configure the Smart Campaign, make sure to set up the Smart List to pull in subscribers from the Stream-specific Static List you created in Step 1.</li>\n</ul>"

Please do not share it with customers or anyone else outside of Uberflip.</li>\n<li>This guide is intended for Uberflippers who are helping a customer to set up a custom domain on a subdirectory. In most cases, this would be a <strong>CSM</strong>, an <strong>Onboarding Specialist</strong>, or a <strong>Solutions Engineer</strong>.</li>\n<li>This guide is intended to complement the <strong>Hubs on Subdirectories setup guide</strong>, which you can find <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019628712\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>A Quick Dubsplat Primer</h2>\n<h3>What is Dubsplat?</h3>\n<p>Dubsplat is a debugging tool. It looks for common problems in Hubs that are served over a reverse proxy. Hubs that use a subdirectory custom domain (i.e. \"Hubs on Dubs\") must use a reverse proxy, so Dubsplat is primarily intended for this type of Hub. However, it will also work on Hubs that use a regular subdomain custom domain, or the default co-branded sub-domain.</p>\n<h3>How Does Dubsplat Work?</h3>\n<p>When a browser visits a Hub, it sends an HTTP request message to the Hub, and the Hub sends back a response message with the requested content. The main difference with a <em>Hubs on Dubs </em>Hub is that these messages need to pass through a proxy server that sits between the browser and the Hub.</p>\n<p>Ideally, we want the proxy to pass the messages between the browser and the Hub unchanged. Most <em>Hubs on Dubs</em> issues happen when the proxy makes changes to these messages, so Dubsplat works by identifying if (and how) this is happening.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360025852391/Custom_Domain__Hubs_on_Subdirectories_Explained___Uberflip_Help.png\" alt=\"Custom_Domain__Hubs_on_Subdirectories_Explained___Uberflip_Help.png\" width=\"698\" height=\"198\"></p>\n<p>Dubsplat compares the request and response messages before and after they pass through the proxy, looking for differences. It does this by first sending requests to the Hub and receiving the returning responses, just like a normal browser. This forms the baseline: Dubsplat now knows what both the original request messages and the response messages from the server looked like.</p>\n<p>To make a comparison, Dubsplat also needs to know what the server actually received, and what it sent back. To get this information, Dubsplat sends its requests to a special <em>@debugging</em> endpoint that exists in every Hub.</p>\n<p>Whenever the <em>@debugging</em> endpoint receives a request, it simply sends back a packet of data (a JSON object) that tells Dubsplat what the request message looked like when it arrived in the Hub, and what the Hub sent back in the response message:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360025852711/Mozilla_Firefox.png\" alt=\"Mozilla_Firefox.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"446\"></p>\n<p>Dubsplat now knows what it sent and what the Hub actually received; and what the Hub sent back and what Dubsplat actually received. If there are any discrepancies, we can assume that they were likely caused the reverse proxy, so Dubsplat flags them as potential issues with the way the reverse proxy is set up.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--success\">\n<h4 class=\"callout__title\">Tip</h4>\n<p>If you want, you can access the <em>@debugging</em> endpoint manually — it's always located in the root directory of a subdomain Hub, or the subdirectory of a Hubs on Dubs Hub:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://hub.uberflip.com/@debugging\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">https://hub.uberflip.com/@debugging</span></a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.uberflip.com/culture/@debugging\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">https://www.uberflip.com/culture/@debugging</span></a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Requesting this endpoint in your browser will display the JSON object that it returns (Firefox will format this nicely; other browsers will just return the raw data). You can see what this looks like in the screenshot above.</p>\n<p>The same information is actually also included in Uberflip's error pages, such as our 404 page. The difference is that, on these pages, it's part of the HTML of the page, rather than a JSON object. This difference in format helps Dubsplat to figure out if a request is reaching Uberflip, but is being sent to an error page rather than an actual Hub.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How Does Dubsplat Help to Identify Reverse Proxy Issues?</h3>\n<p>HTTP request and response messages mainly consist of a list of parameters (header fields) and values. When we talk about a reverse proxy changing these messages, this generally means that it is modifying a value, or simply deleting a parameter altogether.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360025847412/Untitled.png\" alt=\"Untitled.png\" width=\"702\" height=\"146\"></p>\n<p>If the reverse proxy is altering any parameter, there is usually a corresponding setting in the reverse proxy that controls this behaviour. Troubleshooting the reverse proxy configuration is therefore a matter of figuring out exactly what is being changed, then identifying the setting responsible and adjusting it.</p>\n<p>Dubsplat helps with this by flagging specific instances where parameters have been changed or are missing, with a particular focus on parameters that will either break Hub functionality or make the entire Hub inaccessible. Armed with this information, you can then help the customer identify the root cause (i.e. the corresponding setting), allowing them to make the necessary changes. As a bonus, Dubsplat is also able to flag miscellaneous configuration issues, such as problems with SSL or DNS.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Use Dubsplat to Troubleshoot a Hub</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use Dubsplat with any Hub — all you need is the Hub's main URL.</li>\n<li>As noted above, Dubsplat is primarily intended for Hubs on subdirectory custom domains, and will be most useful when used with this type of Hub.</li>\n<li>While you can use Dubsplat at any time, it is mainly designed to test reverse proxy setups, so it is best used once the customer has fully set up their reverse proxy. The appropriate time to use this tool is indicated in the <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019628712\">Hubs on Subdirectories setup guide</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n<strong>Step 1:</strong> Run a Test</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>To begin, open Dubsplat by visiting this URL: <a href=\"https://dubsplat.herokuapp.com/\">https://dubsplat.herokuapp.com/</a>\n</li>\n<li>Enter the URL for the Hub you want to test into the<strong> URL field</strong>. This must be the URL for the homepage of the Hub, and must also include the protocol (http/https). For example:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Incorrect</strong>: www.customer.com/hub/</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Correct</strong>: <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://</span>www.customer.com/hub/</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Test</strong> button to begin the test.</li>\n<li>Dubsplat will run the test, and will return a results page. This should only take a few seconds.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\n<strong>Step 2:</strong> Review Results &amp; Advise Customer</h3>\n<p>When the test has completed, Dubsplat will display the results page. This page will contain one or more messages, and each message corresponds to a specific issue that Dubsplat has identified. These messages point out problems which<strong> require action by the customer</strong> to resolve.</p>\n<p>There are four types of message:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Success</strong>: This message will appear by itself, and indicates that Dubsplat did not find problems in any of the areas it is able to test. This means the reverse proxy is most likely set up correctly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Testing Failed</strong>: These messages will appear when Dubsplat was unable to connect, and therefore could not complete testing.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Warning</strong>: These messages indicate that Dubsplat connected to the specified URL, but something went wrong and Dubsplat could not identify the exact problem.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Error:</strong> Messages of this type signal that Dubsplat identified a specific problem with the reverse proxy setup (reverse proxy is making an unwanted change).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each message (except for the <strong>Success</strong> message) contains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A brief description of the problem that Dubsplat identified</li>\n<li>An explanation of what this means, including what Dubsplat tried to test, how it went wrong, and common reasons why this issue occurs</li>\n<li>Suggestions for how the customer can fix the problem</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Review the results, then <strong>advise the customer as needed</strong> on identified issues and possible fixes. Because there are many different types of reverse proxy software and we can't directly support them all, the solutions provided are mostly general. However, a representative on the customer side who is reasonably knowledgeable about their reverse proxy should be able to use these as a starting point for the specific steps they need to take.</p>\n<h3>\n<strong>Step 3:</strong> Repeat</h3>\n<p>Once the customer has made any needed changes, run the test on Dubsplat again. Continue to repeat this process until all issues have been resolved, and Dubsplat displays the <strong>Success</strong> message.</p>"

These systems create personalized content recommendations for visitors to your Hub and website, and the engine figures out <em>what </em>they should recommend to each visitor.</p>\n<p>The old-fashioned way of recommending content is to simply offer up a list of popular or recent articles. <em>The </em>recommendation engine creates <strong>personalized</strong> recommendations that take the particular interests of each visitor into account. Compared to generic recommendations, this greatly increases the chances that a visitor will continue to consume your content and engage more deeply with your brand.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360023354231\" alt=\"animation-02.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"445\"></p>\n<p>If you're interested in using Content Recommendations or Site Engager, you're probably wondering just how the recommendation engine works: how does it know what to recommend?

Sounds simple, but \"making a recommendation\" is actually a pretty complex problem for a computer. That's because a recommendation is fundamentally a <em>prediction</em>: if a recommendation is the item a person would like the best among many options, pinpointing it means you need to predict how that person would rank all the available options.</p>\n<p>A computers doesn't innately know how to make a prediction. To a computer, making a prediction is like any other problem: it can't solve the problem unless it's given a set of instructions designed specifically to solve that problem. Ultimately, this is what recommendation engines do: they give computers the tools they need to make predictions, and therefore recommendations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J0408G3B4QMYNATV52Z9AFQ3\">How recommendation engines work</h3>\n<p>The technical term for \"a set of instructions to solve a problem\" might sound familiar: <em>algorithm</em>. In the context of recommendation engines, the algorithms that generate recommendations are commonly referred to as <em>recommenders.</em></p>\n<p>There are many different ways to make a recommendation, and each recommender represents a particular approach, such as \"visitors with similar interests also viewed these items\", or \"these items are similar to the one you're viewing\". No single approach will work for everyone, so recommendation engines typically rely on collections of many different recommender algorithms to generate their recommendations. This way, they can cover all their bases: instead of trying to predict a single <em>best</em> recommendation, they can simply generate a <em>list</em> of recommendations in various ways and let the user decide which one they like best.</p>\n<p>Viewed as a complete system, a typical recommendation engine works like this: to begin, information about the user's preferences and the available options is fed into the recommendation engine's various recommender algorithms. Each recommender then processes this data in its own way, and serves up the item it has determined to be the best fit for the user. Once all the recommenders have run, the recommendation engine collects their output and applies any necessary refinements, such as removing duplicates. The end result of this process is a list of items that have been chosen to appeal to a user's interests: in other words, <em>recommendations</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360023354091\" alt=\"ai-animation.gif\" width=\"601\" height=\"332\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J0408G3BS5BEGVWFQRDFW55H\">\n<em>Recommendation engine</em>: The basics</h2>\n<p>At the heart of Uberflip's recommendation engine are over twenty separate recommenders (algorithms) that each take a different approach to recommending content based on visitor interests, content similarity, and other factors.</p>\n<p>Each recommender identifies several options, ranks them according to relevance, then presents just the top option as its \"pick\". This top option must also exceed a minimum confidence threshold to be presented — in some instances, a recommender can't be sufficiently confident that <em>any</em> of the options it has generated will be a good fit for a particular user, in which case it won't present one.</p>\n<p>Because our recommendation engine filters recommendation options at the algorithm level, it can ensure that all of the options that it can select from are essentially equally good. As a result, the process of choosing the final recommendations is straightforward: <em>the engine </em>simply removes any duplicates, then randomly chooses the specified number of recommendations and presents them to the visitor. (On top of this, it also keeps track of visitors to avoid recommending something they've already viewed, and makes sure that a visitor doesn't see the same content recommendation more than five times.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J0408G3BTBE0JYGRFXVZ33F4\">Recommenders: <em>The engine algorithms</em>\n</h2>\n<p>In this article, we won't dive into individual recommenders one-by-one, because that level of detail isn't very interesting. Instead, we'll look at the general concepts that the recommenders are based around. All of the recommenders rely on combinations and variations of these central ideas to generate recommendations, so this should give you a good idea of how they work at a high level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J0408G3BYFT5VA8CMN4SCYX6\">Intent data</h3>\n<p>The best recommendations are specifically tailored to an individual's preferences. To do that at scale, Uberflip's recommendation engine relies on <strong>intent data</strong>. Intent data is information about the topics visitors are interested in — derived from actual observation of their browsing behavior — and focused specifically on the <em>intent</em> to make a purchase related to those topics. This makes it ideal for marketing-specific personalization, which is why about half of <em>engines</em> recommenders take intent data into account in some form.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360023315712\" alt=\"spider-graph.png\" width=\"548\" height=\"347\"></p>\n<p><em>The recommendation engine</em> sources intent data from our partner Bombora, a leading provider of B2B intent data. Bombora uses machine learning to identify page topics based on keyword association, and tracks visitors across a large network of websites. Using this data, Bombora is able to build a profile of a given visitor's interests based on the topics of pages they visit. When you <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022588451\">integrate your Hub with Bombora</a> (which is a requirement for using <em>the recommendation engine</em>), <em>the engine </em>uses this intent data to understand both the topics that your Hub visitors are interested in, and the topics that your content is about.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/article_attachments/360023353871\" alt=\"animation-01-bambora.gif\" width=\"650\" height=\"482\"></p>\n<p>Intent data is what gives <em>the engine</em> the ability to make truly personalized content recommendations for almost any visitor. For example, picture a user who is very interested in ABM. A recommender based on intent data will know this about that user, and can use this knowledge to look at all the available content that it has identified as relating to ABM. From there, it can rank all the options according to their relevance score, then recommend the item with the highest relevance score — an article that it has determined is ~92% about ABM, say.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J0408G3B4KJZBV870Q2F1G0C\">Collaborative filtering</h3>\n<p><strong>Collaborative filtering</strong> is a method used by most recommendation engines in some form, based on the idea that users with similar interests are likely to prefer similar items. Therefore, if you analyze the preferences of a large number of users, you can predict how any given individual would rate a particular item based on how similar users rated it. For example, say Amanda, Ben, and Charlie are all interested in content marketing: if we know that Amanda and Ben are also interested in ABM, then we can assume that Charlie is likely interested in ABM, too — even if he hasn't expressed this interest yet.</p>\n<p>Collaborative filtering is one of the most effective ways of personalizing recommendations, so a large number of <em>Uberflip'</em>s recommenders are based around it. And since collaborative filtering requires data about user preferences, most of these recommenders also rely on intent data to calculate user similarity and predict content preferences.</p>\n<p><em>The recommendation engine's</em> collaborative filtering (CF) recommenders can be broadly divided into two categories, <em>user-based</em> and <em>topic-based</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user-based CF recommender looks at <strong>a </strong><strong>user's intent data</strong> to identify the topic they're most interested in, then recommends items that other users with the same top interest viewed most often.</li>\n<li>A topic-based CF recommender looks at<strong> the current page </strong><strong>a user is viewing</strong> to identify its topic, then recommends items that other users with this topic as their top interest viewed most often.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One particular strength of collaborative filtering recommenders is that they are self-refining, improving as the body of data that feeds into them grows. Plus, they are capable of generating recommendations that are not necessarily related to the topic the user is currently viewing, which can encourage content discovery and drive greater engagement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J0408G3B2PAVQ5ZKQT2CD1ES\">Proximity and popularity</h3>\n<p>Lastly, a number of <em>Uberflip's </em>recommenders revolve around the concepts of <strong>proximity</strong> and <strong>popularity</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Proximity</em> recommenders are based on the simple but effective idea that a user who is viewing a given item is probably interested in that topic, and would likely be interested in similar items about the same topic. By analyzing the content of all the items that can be recommended, proximity recommenders are able to calculate a numerical value for the \"distance\" between any two items based on how similar they are (i.e. how much overlap there is between the topics that they cover), then recommend the item that is closest (most similar) to the one currently being viewed.</p>\n<p><em>Popularity</em> recommenders have an even more straightforward premise: the most popular items are top performers because they have wide appeal among the target audience, and are therefore a safe bet to recommend to any user. This kind of recommender will identify the content with the most page views in a given period, or the highest click-through rates, and recommend it regardless of the user's current context. Although this type of recommender offers the least amount of personalization, its recommendations still tend to be effective. Moreover, it also serves a valuable role as a backup in cases where not enough intent data exists to offer more personalized recommendations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J0408G3BCY8610KT85R1YN2N\">Next steps</h2>\n<p>Now that you know how the Uberflip recommendation engine comes up with recommendations, try it out for yourself: learn how to set up <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022410572\"><strong>Content Recommendations</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://help.uberflip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022595791\"><strong>Site Engager</strong></a> to begin serving algorithm-powered, personalized content recommendations at scale.</p>"
